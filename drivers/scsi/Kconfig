config SCSI_LOGGING

	  This turns on a logging facility that can be used to debug a number

	  can enable logging by saying Y to "/proc file system support" and
	  "Sysctl support" below and executing the command

	  echo "scsi log token [level]" > /proc/scsi/scsi

	  at boot time after the /proc file system has been mounted.

	  There are a number of things that can be used for 'token' (you can
	  find them in the source: <file:drivers/scsi/scsi.c>), and this
	  allows you to select the types of information you want, and the
	  level allows you to select the level of verbosity.

	  If you say N here, it may be harder to track down some types of SCSI
	  problems. If you say Y here your kernel will be somewhat larger, but
	  there should be no noticeable performance impact as long as you have
	  logging turned off.

	  support them. It does not support the 2920 cards from Adaptec that
	  use the Future Domain SCSI controller chip. For those cards, you

	  In general, if the controller is based on an Adaptec SCSI controller

	  If the adapter isn't found during boot (a common problem for models

config IBMMCA_SCSI_ORDER_STANDARD
	bool "Standard SCSI-order"

	---help---
	  In the PC-world and in most modern SCSI-BIOS-setups, SCSI-hard disks
	  are assigned to the drive letters, starting with the lowest SCSI-id
	  (physical number -- pun) to be drive C:, as seen from DOS and
	  similar operating systems. When looking into papers describing the
	  ANSI-SCSI-standard, this assignment of drives appears to be wrong.
	  The SCSI-standard follows a hardware-hierarchy which says that id 7
	  has the highest priority and id 0 the lowest. Therefore, the host
	  adapters are still today everywhere placed as SCSI-id 7 by default.
	  In the SCSI-standard, the drive letters express the priority of the
	  disk. C: should be the hard disk, or a partition on it, with the
	  highest priority. This must therefore be the disk with the highest
	  SCSI-id (e.g. 6) and not the one with the lowest! IBM-BIOS kept the
	  original definition of the SCSI-standard as also industrial- and
	  process-control-machines, like VME-CPUs running under realtime-OSes
	  (e.g. LynxOS, OS9) do.

	  If you like to run Linux on your MCA-machine with the same
	  assignment of hard disks as seen from e.g. DOS or OS/2 on your
	  machine, which is in addition conformant to the SCSI-standard, you
	  must say Y here. This is also necessary for MCA-Linux users who want
	  to keep downward compatibility to older releases of the
	  IBM-MCA-SCSI-driver (older than driver-release 2.00 and older than
	  June 1997).

	  If you like to have the lowest SCSI-id assigned as drive C:, as
	  modern SCSI-BIOSes do, which does not conform to the standard, but
	  is widespread and common in the PC-world of today, you must say N
	  here. If unsure, say Y.

config IBMMCA_SCSI_DEV_RESET

	  However, some devices exist, like special-control-devices,
	  SCSI-CNC-machines, SCSI-printer or scanners of older type, that do
	  not reset when switched on. If you say Y here, each device connected
	  to your SCSI-bus will be issued a reset-command after it has been
	  probed, while the kernel is booting. This may cause problems with
	  more modern devices, like hard disks, which do not appreciate these
	  reset commands, and can cause your system to hang. So say Y only if

	  The safest value is 0 (32 bit DMA addressing) that is guessed to still

	---help---
	  "Tagged command queuing" is a feature of SCSI-2 which improves
	  performance: the host adapter can send several SCSI commands to a
	  device's queue even if previous commands haven't finished yet.
	  Because the device is intelligent, it can optimize its operations
	  (like head positioning) based on its own request queue. Some SCSI
	  devices don't implement this properly; if you want to disable this
	  feature, enter 0 or 1 here (it doesn't matter which).

	  The default value is 8 and should be supported by most hard disks.
	  This value can be overridden from the boot command line using the
	  'tags' option as follows (example):
	  'ncr53c8xx=tags:4/t2t3q16/t0u2q10' will set default queue depth to
	  4, set queue depth to 16 for target 2 and target 3 on controller 0
	  and set queue depth to 10 for target 0 / lun 2 on controller 1.

	  The normal answer therefore is to go with the default 8 and to use
	  a boot command line option for devices that need to use a different
	  command queue depth.

	  per second for each class.  For example, a FAST-20 Wide 16 device is
	  able to transfer data at 20 million 16 bit packets per second for a
	  total rate of 40 MB/s.

	  You may specify 0 if you want to only use asynchronous data
	  transfers. This is the safest and slowest option. Otherwise, specify
	  a value between 5 and 80, depending on the capability of your SCSI
	  controller.  The higher the number, the faster the data transfer.
	  Note that 80 should normally be ok since the driver decreases the
	  value automatically according to the controller's capabilities.

	  Your answer to this question is ignored for controllers with NVRAM,
	  since the driver will get this information from the user set-up.  It
	  also can be overridden using a boot setup option, as follows
	  (example): 'ncr53c8xx=sync:12' will allow the driver to negotiate
	  for FAST-20 synchronous data transfer (20 mega-transfers per
	  second).

	  The normal answer therefore is not to go with the default but to
	  select the maximum value 80 allowing the driver to use the maximum
	  value supported by each controller. If this causes problems with
	  your SCSI devices, you should come back and decrease the value.

	  There is no safe option other than using good cabling, right
	  terminations and SCSI conformant devices.

	  This option allows you to enable profiling information gathering.
	  These statistics are not very accurate due to the low frequency

	  and works for most Intel-based hardware. Under Linux/Alpha only

	  uses a different GPIO wiring.

	  Your answer to this question is ignored if all your controllers have
	  NVRAM, since the driver is able to detect the board type from the

	  If all the controllers in your system are genuine SYMBIOS boards or
