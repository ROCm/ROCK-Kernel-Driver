# fcp-bind-WWPN binds a specific WorldWide PortName to a target id,
# fcp-bind-WWNN binds a specific WorldWide NodeName to a target id,
# fcp-bind-DID binds a specific DID to a target id.
# Each array must end with a NULL pointer.
# Binding method must match with the bind method of that HBA, else the
# binding will be ignored.
# scan-down should NOT be set to 2 when one of these binding methods

# to bind to, and the target number for that interface.

# Cautions:  
# (1)  This value is in seconds.  
# (2)  Setting a long delay value may permit I/O to build up, each with a
# pending timeout, which could result in the exhaustion of critical kernel
# resources. 
# Value range is [0,30]. Default value is 1.
#
# Note that this value can have an impact on the speed with which a
# system can shut down with I/Os pending and with the HBA not able to
