# The new 8250/16550 serial drivers
config SERIAL_8250
	tristate "8250/16550 and compatible serial support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  This selects whether you want to include the driver for the standard
	  serial ports.  The standard answer is Y.  People who might say N
	  here are those that are setting up dedicated Ethernet WWW/FTP
	  servers, or users that have one of the various bus mice instead of a
	  serial mouse and don't intend to use their machine's standard serial
	  port for anything.  (Note that the Cyclades and Stallion multi
	  serial port drivers do not need this driver built in for them to
	  work.)

	  If you want to compile this driver as a module, say M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module will be called
	  serial.
	  [WARNING: Do not compile this driver as a module if you are using
	  non-standard serial ports, since the configuration information will
	  be lost when the driver is unloaded.  This limitation may be lifted
	  in the future.]

	  BTW1: If you have a mouseman serial mouse which is not recognized by
	  the X window system, try running gpm first.

	  BTW2: If you intend to use a software modem (also called Winmodem)
	  under Linux, forget it.  These modems are crippled and require
	  proprietary drivers which are only available under Windows.

	  Most people will say Y or M here, so that they can use serial mice,
	  modems and similar devices connecting to the standard serial ports.

config SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE
	bool "Console on 8250/16550 and compatible serial port (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on SERIAL_8250=y
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, it will be possible to use a serial port as the
	  system console (the system console is the device which receives all
	  kernel messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user
	  mode). This could be useful if some terminal or printer is connected
	  to that serial port.

	  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible virtual console
	  (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
	  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
	  "console=ttyS1". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
	  your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the
	  kernel at boot time.)

	  If you don't have a VGA card installed and you say Y here, the
	  kernel will automatically use the first serial line, /dev/ttyS0, as
	  system console.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SERIAL_8250_CS
	tristate "8250/16550 PCMCIA device support"
	depends on PCMCIA && SERIAL_8250
	---help---
	  Say Y here to enable support for 16-bit PCMCIA serial devices,
	  including serial port cards, modems, and the modem functions of
	  multi-function Ethernet/modem cards. (PCMCIA- or PC-cards are
	  credit-card size devices often used with laptops.)

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called serial_cs.  If you want to compile it as
	  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
	  If unsure, say N.

config SERIAL_8250_EXTENDED
	bool "Extended 8250/16550 serial driver options"
	depends on SERIAL_8250
	help
	  If you wish to use any non-standard features of the standard "dumb"
	  driver, say Y here. This includes HUB6 support, shared serial
	  interrupts, special multiport support, support for more than the
	  four COM 1/2/3/4 boards, etc.

	  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about serial driver options. If unsure, say N.

config SERIAL_8250_MANY_PORTS
	bool "Support more than 4 serial ports"
	depends on SERIAL_8250_EXTENDED
	help
	  Say Y here if you have dumb serial boards other than the four
	  standard COM 1/2/3/4 ports. This may happen if you have an AST
	  FourPort, Accent Async, Boca (read the Boca mini-HOWTO, available
	  from <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>), or other custom
	  serial port hardware which acts similar to standard serial port
	  hardware. If you only use the standard COM 1/2/3/4 ports, you can
	  say N here to save some memory. You can also say Y if you have an
	  "intelligent" multiport card such as Cyclades, Digiboards, etc.

config SERIAL_8250_SHARE_IRQ
	bool "Support for sharing serial interrupts"
	depends on SERIAL_8250_EXTENDED
	help
	  Some serial boards have hardware support which allows multiple dumb
	  serial ports on the same board to share a single IRQ. To enable
	  support for this in the serial driver, say Y here.

config SERIAL_8250_DETECT_IRQ
	bool "Autodetect IRQ on standard ports (unsafe)"
	depends on SERIAL_8250_EXTENDED
	help
	  Say Y here if you want the kernel to try to guess which IRQ
	  to use for your serial port.

	  This is considered unsafe; it is far better to configure the IRQ in
	  a boot script using the setserial command.

	  If unsure, say N.

config SERIAL_8250_MULTIPORT
	bool "Support special multiport boards"
	depends on SERIAL_8250_EXTENDED
	help
	  Some multiport serial ports have special ports which are used to
	  signal when there are any serial ports on the board which need
	  servicing. Say Y here to enable the serial driver to take advantage
	  of those special I/O ports.

config SERIAL_8250_RSA

	  If you have an Atomwide Serial card or Serial Port card for an Acorn
	  system, say Y to this option.  The driver can handle 1, 2, or 3 port
	  cards.  If unsure, say N.

	  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as

	  If unsure, say N.

config SERIAL_AMBA_CONSOLE
	bool "Support for console on AMBA serial port"

	  Say Y here if you wish to use an AMBA PrimeCell UART as the system
	  console (the system console is the device which receives all kernel
	  messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user mode).

	  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible framebuffer console

	  If you have enabled the serial port on the 21285 footbridge you can

	  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible virtual console

	  Saying Y here will enable the hardware MUX serial driver for

	    1. create the device entry (mknod /dev/ttyB0 c 11 0)
	    2. Edit the /etc/inittab to start a getty listening on /dev/ttyB0
	    3. Add device ttyB0 to /etc/securetty (if you want to log on as
