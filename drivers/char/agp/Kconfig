	  AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port) is a bus system mainly used to
	  connect graphics cards to the rest of the system.

	  If you have an AGP system and you say Y here, it will be possible to
	  use the AGP features of your 3D rendering video card. This code acts
	  as a sort of "AGP driver" for the motherboard's chipset.

	  If you need more texture memory than you can get with the AGP GART
	  (theoretically up to 256 MB, but in practice usually 64 or 128 MB
	  due to kernel allocation issues), you could use PCI accesses
	  and have up to a couple gigs of texture space.

	  Note that this is the only means to have XFree4/GLX use
	  write-combining with MTRR support on the AGP bus. Without it, OpenGL
	  direct rendering will be a lot slower but still faster than PIO.

	  You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to
	  use GLX or DRI.  If unsure, say N.

	  This driver is available as a module.  If you want to compile it as
	  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The
	  module will be called agpgart.

	help
	  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of the
	  XFree86 4.x on Intel 440LX/BX/GX, 815, 820, 830, 840, 845, 850, 860
	  E7205 and E7505 chipsets and full support for the 810, 815, 830M, 845G,
	  852GM, 855GM and 865G integrated graphics chipsets.

	  You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to
	  use GLX or DRI, or if you have any Intel integrated graphics
	  chipsets.  If unsure, say Y.

#	  This option gives you AGP support for the Xserver on the Intel 810
#	  815 and 830m chipset boards for their on-board integrated graphics. This
#	  is required to do any useful video modes with these boards.

config AGP_VIA
	tristate "VIA chipset support"

	help
	  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of the
	  XFree86 4.x on VIA MPV3/Apollo Pro chipsets.

	  You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to
	  use GLX or DRI.  If unsure, say N.

config AGP_AMD
	tristate "AMD Irongate, 761, and 762 support"

	  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of the
	  XFree86 4.x on AMD Irongate, 761, and 762 chipsets.

	  You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to

config AGP_SIS
	tristate "Generic SiS support"

	help
	  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of the "soon
	  to be released" XFree86 4.x on Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS]
	  chipsets.

	  Note that 5591/5592 AGP chipsets are NOT supported.

	  You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to
	  use GLX or DRI.  If unsure, say N.

config AGP_ALI
	tristate "ALI chipset support"
	depends on AGP && X86 && !X86_64
	---help---
	  This option gives you AGP support for the GLX component of the
	  XFree86 4.x on the following ALi chipsets.  The supported chipsets
	  include M1541, M1621, M1631, M1632, M1641,M1647,and M1651.
	  For the ALi-chipset question, ALi suggests you refer to
	  <http://www.ali.com.tw/eng/support/index.shtml>.

	  The M1541 chipset can do AGP 1x and 2x, but note that there is an
	  acknowledged incompatibility with Matrox G200 cards. Due to
	  timing issues, this chipset cannot do AGP 2x with the G200.
	  This is a hardware limitation. AGP 1x seems to be fine, though.

	  You should say Y here if you use XFree86 3.3.6 or 4.x and want to
	  use GLX or DRI.  If unsure, say N.
