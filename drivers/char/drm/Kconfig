	bool "Direct Rendering Manager (XFree86 4.1.0 and higher DRI support)"
	help
	  Kernel-level support for the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI)
	  introduced in XFree86 4.0. If you say Y here, you need to select
	  the module that's right for your graphics card from the list below.
	  These modules provide support for synchronization, security, and
	  DMA transfers. Please see <http://dri.sourceforge.net/> for more
	  details.  You should also select and configure AGP
	  (/dev/agpgart) support.

config DRM_TDFX
	tristate "3dfx Banshee/Voodoo3+"
	depends on DRM
	help
	  Choose this option if you have a 3dfx Banshee or Voodoo3 (or later),
	  graphics card.  If M is selected, the module will be called tdfx.

config DRM_GAMMA
	tristate "3dlabs GMX 2000"
	depends on DRM && n
	help
	  This is the old gamma driver, disabled for now unless somebody
	  tells me it actually might work.

config DRM_R128
	tristate "ATI Rage 128"
	depends on DRM
	help
	  Choose this option if you have an ATI Rage 128 graphics card.  If M

	  this card is strongly suggested (unless you have a PCI version).

config DRM_RADEON
	tristate "ATI Radeon"
	depends on DRM && AGP
	help
	  Choose this option if you have an ATI Radeon graphics card.  There
	  are both PCI and AGP versions.  You don't need to choose this to
	  run the Radeon in plain VGA mode.  There is a product page at
	  <http://www.ati.com/na/pages/products/pc/radeon32/index.html>.
	  If M is selected, the module will be called radeon.

config DRM_I810

	depends on DRM && AGP
	help
	  Choose this option if you have an Intel I810 graphics card.  If M is

	  card.  If M is selected, the module will be called mga.  AGP
