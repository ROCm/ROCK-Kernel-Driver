 * changed in a way the state could've become out-of-sync. This is the case
 * for instance when the link rate between the source and first downstream
 * branch device has switched between UHBR and non-UHBR rates. Except of those
 * cases - for instance when a sink gets plugged/unplugged to a port - the SW
 * state will get updated automatically via MST UP message notifications.
