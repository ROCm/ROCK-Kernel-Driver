#
# The 'sources' file contains source/destination directives to be used
# by the build framework to construct the DKMS source tree
#
# File format:
#   source                  destination
#   ------                  -----------
#   directory[/file] name   directory/[file] name
#   must exist at the       directory: must have explicit directory name
#   source path                        e.g. dir/ (with '/'). The name without
#                                      slash is treated as a file if it does
#                                      not exist
#                                      the directory will be created if it
#                                      does not exist
#                           file: optional file name at the destination
