# USB Gadget support on a system involves

#    (b) the gadget driver using it.
#
# NOTE:  Gadget support ** DOES NOT ** depend on host-side CONFIG_USB !!
#
#  - Host systems (like PCs) need CONFIG_USB (with "A" jacks).
#  - Peripherals (like PDAs) need CONFIG_USB_GADGET (with "B" jacks).
#  - Some systems have both kinds of of controller.
#
# With help from a special transceiver and a "Mini-AB" jack, systems with
# both kinds of controller can also support "USB On-the-Go" (CONFIG_USB_OTG).

config USB_GADGET
	tristate "Support for USB Gadgets"
	help
	   USB is a master/slave protocol, organized with one master
	   host (such as a PC) controlling up to 127 peripheral devices.
	   The USB hardware is asymmetric, which makes it easier to set up:
	   you can't connect a "to-the-host" connector to a peripheral.

	   Linux can run in the host, or in the peripheral.  In both cases
	   you need a low level bus controller driver, and some software
	   talking to it.  Peripheral controllers are often discrete silicon,
	   or are integrated with the CPU in a microcontroller.  The more
	   familiar host side controllers have names like like "EHCI", "OHCI",
	   or "UHCI", and are usually integrated into southbridges on PC
	   motherboards.

	   Enable this configuration option if you want to run Linux inside
	   a USB peripheral device.  Configure one hardware driver for your
	   peripheral/device side bus controller, and a "gadget driver" for
	   your peripheral protocol.  (If you use modular gadget drivers,
	   you may configure more than one.)

	   If in doubt, say "N" and don't enable these drivers; most people
	   don't have this kind of hardware (except maybe inside Linux PDAs).

	  This host controller driver emulates USB, looping all data transfer
	  requests back to a USB "gadget driver" in the same host.  The host
	  side is the master; the gadget side is the slave.  Gadget drivers
	  can be high, full, or low speed; and they have access to endpoints
	  like those from NET2280, PXA2xx, or SA1100 hardware.
	  
	  This may help in some stages of creating a driver to embed in a
	  Linux device, since it lets you debug several parts of the gadget
	  driver without its hardware or drivers being involved.

config USB_ZERO
	tristate "Gadget Zero (DEVELOPMENT)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Gadget Zero is a two-configuration device.  It either sinks and
	  sources bulk data; or it loops back a configurable number of
	  transfers.  It also implements control requests, for "chapter 9"
	  conformance.  The driver needs only two bulk-capable endpoints, so
	  it can work on top of most device-side usb controllers.  It's
	  useful for testing, and is also a working example showing how
	  USB "gadget drivers" can be written.

	  Make this be the first driver you try using on top of any new
	  USB peripheral controller driver.  Then you can use host-side
	  test software, like the "usbtest" driver, to put your hardware
	  and its driver through a basic set of functional tests.

	  Gadget Zero also works with the host-side "usb-skeleton" driver,
	  and with many kinds of host-side test software.  You may need
	  to tweak product and vendor IDs before host software knows about
	  this device, and arrange to select an appropriate configuration.

	  dynamically linked module called "g_zero".

config USB_ETH
	tristate "Ethernet Gadget"
	depends on NET
	help
	  This driver implements Ethernet style communication, in either
	  of two ways:
	  
	   - The "Communication Device Class" (CDC) Ethernet Control Model.
	     That protocol is often avoided with pure Ethernet adapters, in
	     favor of simpler vendor-specific hardware, but is widely
	     supported by firmware for smart network devices.

	   - On hardware can't implement that protocol, a simple CDC subset
	     is used, placing fewer demands on USB.

	  RNDIS support is a third option, more demanding than that subset.

	  Within the USB device, this gadget driver exposes a network device
	  "usbX", where X depends on what other networking devices you have.
	  Treat it like a two-node Ethernet link:  host, and gadget.

	  The Linux-USB host-side "usbnet" driver interoperates with this
	  driver, so that deep I/O queues can be supported.  On 2.4 kernels,
	  use "CDCEther" instead, if you're using the CDC option. That CDC
	  mode should also interoperate with standard CDC Ethernet class
	  drivers on other host operating systems.

	  Say "y" to link the driver statically, or "m" to build a
	  dynamically linked module called "g_ether".
