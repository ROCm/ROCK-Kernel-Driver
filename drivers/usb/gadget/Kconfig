	   USB is a master/slave protocol, organized with with one master
	   host (such as a PC) controlling up to 127 peripheral devices.
	   The USB hardware is asymmetric, which makes it easier to set up:
	   you can't connect two "to-the-host" connectors to each other.

	   Linux can run in the host, or in the peripheral.  In both cases
	   you need a low level bus controller driver, and some software
	   talking to it.  Peripheral controllers are often discrete silicon,
	   or are integrated with the CPU in a microcontroller.  The more
	   familiar host side controllers have names like like "EHCI", "OHCI",
	   or "UHCI", and are usually integrated into southbridges on PC
	   motherboards.

	   Enable this configuration option if you want to run Linux inside
	   a USB peripheral device.  Configure one hardware driver for your
	   peripheral/device side bus controller, and a "gadget driver" for
	   your peripheral protocol.  (If you use modular gadget drivers,
	   you may configure more than one.)

	   If in doubt, say "N" and don't enable these drivers; most people
	   don't have this kind of hardware (except maybe inside Linux PDAs).

	help
	   NetChip 2280 is a PCI based USB peripheral controller which
	   supports both full and high speed USB 2.0 data transfers.  
	   
	   It has six configurable endpoints, as well as endpoint zero
	   (for control transfers) and several endpoints with dedicated
	   functions.

	   Say "y" to link the driver statically, or "m" to build a
	   dynamically linked module called "net2280" and force all
	   gadget drivers to also be dynamically linked.

# FIXME want better dependency/config approach for drivers.  with only

	help
	  Gadget Zero is a two-configuration device.  It either sinks and
	  sources bulk data; or it loops back a configurable number of
	  transfers.  It also implements control requests, for "chapter 9"
	  conformance.  The driver needs only two bulk-capable endpoints, so
	  it can work on top of most device-side usb controllers.  It's
	  useful for testing, and is also a working example showing how
	  USB "gadget drivers" can be written.

	  Make this be the first driver you try using on top of any new
	  USB peripheral controller driver.  Then you can use host-side
	  test software, like the "usbtest" driver, to put your hardware
	  and its driver through a basic set of functional tests.

	  Gadget Zero also works with the host-side "usb-skeleton" driver,
	  and with many kinds of host-side test software.  You may need
	  to tweak product and vendor IDs before host software knows about
	  this device, and arrange to select an appropriate configuration.

	  Say "y" to link the driver statically, or "m" to build a
	  dynamically linked module called "g_zero".

	help
	  This driver implements the "Communication Device Class" (CDC)
	  Ethernet Control Model.  That protocol is often avoided with pure
	  Ethernet adapters, in favor of simpler vendor-specific hardware,
	  but is widely suppored by firmware for smart network devices.

	  Within the USB device, this gadget driver exposes a network device
	  "usbX", where X depends on what other networking devices you have.
	  Treat it like a two-node Ethernet link:  host, and gadget.

	  The Linux-USB host-side "usbnet" driver interoperates with this
	  driver, so that deep I/O queues can be supported.  (On 2.4 kernels,
	  use "CDCEther" instead.)  Deep queues are especially important with
	  high speed devices.  It should also interoperate with standard CDC
	  Ethernet class drivers on other host operating systems.

	  Say "y" to link the driver statically, or "m" to build a
	  dynamically linked module called "g_ether".
