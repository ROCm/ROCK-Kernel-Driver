config USB_EMI26
	tristate "EMI 2|6 USB Audio interface support"
	depends on USB_AUDIO
	---help---
	  This driver loads firmware to Emagic EMI 2|6 low latency USB
	  Audio interface.

	  After firmware load the device is handled with standard linux
	  USB Audio driver.

	  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called audio. If you want to compile it as a
	  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

config USB_TIGL
	tristate "Texas Instruments Graph Link USB (aka SilverLink) cable support"
	depends on USB
	---help---
	  If you own a Texas Instruments graphing calculator and use a 
	  TI-GRAPH LINK USB cable (aka SilverLink), then you might be 
	  interested in this driver.

	  If you enable this driver, you will be able to communicate with
	  your calculator through a set of device nodes under /dev.

	  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called tiglusb. If you want to compile it as a
	  module, say M here and read Documentation/modules.txt.

	  If you don't know what the SilverLink cable is or what a Texas
	  Instruments graphing calculator is, then you probably don't need this
	  driver.

	  If unsure, say N.

config USB_AUERSWALD
	tristate "USB Auerswald ISDN support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to connect an Auerswald USB ISDN Device
	  to your computer's USB port.

	  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called auerswald. If you want to compile it as
	  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

config USB_RIO500
	tristate "USB Diamond Rio500 support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to connect a USB Rio500 mp3 player to your
	  computer's USB port. Please read <file:Documentation/usb/rio.txt>
	  for more information.

	  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called rio500. If you want to compile it as
	  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

config USB_BRLVGER
	tristate "Tieman Voyager USB Braille display support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on USB && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to use the Voyager USB Braille display from
	  Tieman. See <file:Documentation/usb/brlvger.txt> for more
	  information.

	  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called brlvger. If you want to compile it as
	  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

config USB_LCD
	tristate "USB LCD driver support"
	depends on USB
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to connect an USBLCD to your computer's
	  USB port. The USBLCD is a small USB interface board for
	  alphanumeric LCD modules. See <http://www.usblcd.de> for more
	  information.

	  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called usblcd. If you want to compile it as
	  a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

config USB_SPEEDTOUCH

config USB_TEST
	tristate "USB testing driver (DEVELOPMENT)"
	depends on USB && USB_DEVICEFS && EXPERIMENTAL
	help

	  This driver is for testing host controller software.  It is used
	  with specialized device firmware for regression and stress testing,
	  to help prevent problems from cropping up with "real" drivers.

	  See <http://www.linux-usb.org/usbtest> for more information,
	  including sample test device firmware and "how to use it".
