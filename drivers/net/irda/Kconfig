comment "SIR device drivers"

config IRTTY_SIR
	tristate "IrTTY (uses Linux serial driver)"
	depends on IRDA
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrTTY line
	  discipline.  If you want to compile it as a module (irtty-sir), say M
	  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  IrTTY makes it
	  possible to use Linux's own serial driver for all IrDA ports that
	  are 16550 compatible.  Most IrDA chips are 16550 compatible so you
	  should probably say Y to this option.  Using IrTTY will however
	  limit the speed of the connection to 115200 bps (IrDA SIR mode).

	  If unsure, say Y.

comment "Dongle support"

config DONGLE
	bool "Serial dongle support"
	help
	  Say Y here if you have an infrared device that connects to your
	  computer's serial port. These devices are called dongles. Then say Y
	  or M to the driver for your particular dongle below.

	  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about serial dongles.

config ESI_DONGLE
	tristate "ESI JetEye PC dongle"
	depends on DONGLE && IRDA
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to build support for the Extended Systems
	  JetEye PC dongle.  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here
	  and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The ESI dongle attaches
	  to the normal 9-pin serial port connector, and can currently only be
	  used by IrTTY.  To activate support for ESI dongles you will have to
	  start irattach like this: "irattach -d esi".

config ACTISYS_DONGLE
	tristate "ACTiSYS IR-220L and IR220L+ dongle"
	depends on DONGLE && IRDA
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to build support for the ACTiSYS IR-220L and
	  IR220L+ dongles.  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here
	  and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The ACTiSYS dongles
	  attaches to the normal 9-pin serial port connector, and can
	  currently only be used by IrTTY.  To activate support for ACTiSYS
	  dongles you will have to start irattach like this:
	  "irattach -d actisys" or "irattach -d actisys+".

config TEKRAM_DONGLE
	tristate "Tekram IrMate 210B dongle"
	depends on DONGLE && IRDA
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to build support for the Tekram IrMate 210B
	  dongle.  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The Tekram dongle attaches to the
	  normal 9-pin serial port connector, and can currently only be used
	  by IrTTY.  To activate support for Tekram dongles you will have to
	  start irattach like this: "irattach -d tekram".

comment "Old SIR device drivers"

config IRTTY_OLD
	tristate "Old IrTTY (broken)"
	depends on IRDA
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrTTY line
	  discipline.  If you want to compile it as a module (irtty), say M
	  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  IrTTY makes it
	  possible to use Linux's own serial driver for all IrDA ports that
	  are 16550 compatible.  Most IrDA chips are 16550 compatible so you
	  should probably say Y to this option.  Using IrTTY will however
	  limit the speed of the connection to 115200 bps (IrDA SIR mode).

	  If unsure, say N.

config IRPORT_SIR
	tristate "IrPORT (IrDA serial driver)"
	depends on IRDA
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to build support for the IrPORT IrDA device
	  driver. If you want to compile it as a module (irport), say M here
	  and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  IrPORT can be used
	  instead of IrTTY and sometimes this can be better.  One example is
	  if your IrDA port does not have echo-canceling, which will work OK
	  with IrPORT since this driver is working in half-duplex mode only.
	  You don't need to use irattach with IrPORT, but you just insert it
	  the same way as FIR drivers (insmod irport io=0x3e8 irq=11).  Notice
	  that IrPORT is a SIR device driver which means that speed is limited
	  to 115200 bps.

	  If unsure, say Y.
