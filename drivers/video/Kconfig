config FB
	bool "Support for frame buffer devices"
	---help---
	  The frame buffer device provides an abstraction for the graphics
	  hardware. It represents the frame buffer of some video hardware and
	  allows application software to access the graphics hardware through
	  a well-defined interface, so the software doesn't need to know
	  anything about the low-level (hardware register) stuff.

	  Frame buffer devices work identically across the different
	  architectures supported by Linux and make the implementation of
	  application programs easier and more portable; at this point, an X
	  server exists which uses the frame buffer device exclusively.
	  On several non-X86 architectures, the frame buffer device is the
	  only way to use the graphics hardware.

	  The device is accessed through special device nodes, usually located
	  in the /dev directory, i.e. /dev/fb*.

	  You need an utility program called fbset to make full use of frame
	  buffer devices. Please read <file:Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt>
	  and the Framebuffer-HOWTO at
	  <http://www.tahallah.demon.co.uk/programming/prog.html> for more
	  information.

	  Say Y here and to the driver for your graphics board below if you
	  are compiling a kernel for a non-x86 architecture.

	  If you are compiling for the x86 architecture, you can say Y if you
	  want to play with it, but it is not essential. Please note that
	  running graphical applications that directly touch the hardware
	  (e.g. an accelerated X server) and that are not frame buffer
	  device-aware may cause unexpected results. If unsure, say N.

	  chips: GD-543x, GD-544x, GD-5480.

config FB_STI
	bool "Generic STI frame buffer device support"
	depends on FB && PARISC
	---help---
	  STI refers to the HP "Standard Text Interface" which is a set of
	  BIOS routines contained in a ROM chip in HP PA-RISC based machines.
	  Enabling this option will implement the linux framebuffer device and
	  an fbcon color text console using calls to the STI BIOS routines.
	  The HP framebuffer device is usually planar, uses a strange memory
	  layout, and changing the plane mask to create colored pixels
	  requires a call to the STI routines, so do not expect /dev/fb to
	  actually be useful.  However, it is the best we have as far as
	  graphics on the HP chipsets due to lack of hardware level
	  documentation for the various on-board HP chipsets used in these
	  systems.  It is sufficient for basic text console functions,
	  including fonts.

	  You should probably enable this option, unless you are having
	  trouble getting video when booting the kernel (make sure it isn't
	  just that you are running the console on the serial port, though).
	  Really old HP boxes may not have STI, and must use the PDC BIOS
	  console or the IODC BIOS.

	  ("multihead"). If you have only one device, you should say N because
	  the driver compiled with Y is larger and a bit slower, especially on
	  ia32 (ix86).

	  If you said M to "Matrox unified accelerated driver" and N here, you
	  will still be able to use several Matrox devices simultaneously:
	  insert several instances of the module matroxfb.o into the kernel
	  with insmod, supplying the parameter "dev=N" where N is 0, 1, etc.
	  for the different Matrox devices. This method is slightly faster but
	  uses 40 KB of kernel memory per Matrox card.

	  There is no need for enabling 'Matrox multihead support' if you have
	  only one Matrox card in the box.

config FB_VIRTUAL

	---help---
	  This is a `virtual' frame buffer device. It operates on a chunk of
	  unswappable kernel memory instead of on the memory of a graphics
	  board. This means you cannot see any output sent to this frame
	  buffer device, while it does consume precious memory. The main use
	  of this frame buffer device is testing and debugging the frame
	  buffer subsystem. Do NOT enable it for normal systems! To protect
	  the innocent, it has to be enabled explicitly at boot time using the
	  kernel option `video=vfb:'.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted and removed from the running kernel whenever you want). The
	  module will be called vfb.o. If you want to compile it as a module,
	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

	  If unsure, say N.
