config PCMCIA
	tristate "PCMCIA/CardBus support"
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to attach PCMCIA- or PC-cards to your Linux
	  computer.  These are credit-card size devices such as network cards,
	  modems or hard drives often used with laptops computers.  There are
	  actually two varieties of these cards: the older 16 bit PCMCIA cards
	  and the newer 32 bit CardBus cards.  If you want to use CardBus
	  cards, you need to say Y here and also to "CardBus support" below.

	  To use your PC-cards, you will need supporting software from David
	  Hinds' pcmcia-cs package (see the file <file:Documentation/Changes>
	  for location).  Please also read the PCMCIA-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as modules, choose M here: the
	  modules will be called pcmcia_core and ds.

config PCMCIA_DEBUG
	bool "Enable PCMCIA debugging"
	depends on PCMCIA != n
	help
	  Say Y here to enable PCMCIA subsystem debugging.  You
	  will need to choose the debugging level either via the
	  kernel command line, or module options depending whether
	  you build the PCMCIA as modules.

	  The kernel command line options are:
	    pcmcia_core.pc_debug=N
	    ds.pc_debug=N
	    sa11xx_core.pc_debug=N

	  The module option is called pc_debug=N

	  In all the above examples, N is the debugging verbosity
	  level.

config YENTA
	tristate "CardBus yenta-compatible bridge support"
	depends on PCMCIA && PCI
	---help---
	  CardBus is a bus mastering architecture for PC-cards, which allows
	  for 32 bit PC-cards (the original PCMCIA standard specifies only
	  a 16 bit wide bus). Many newer PC-cards are actually CardBus cards.

	  This option enables support for CardBus PC Cards, as well as support
	  for CardBus host bridges.  Virtually all modern PCMCIA bridges are
	  CardBus compatible.  A "bridge" is the hardware inside your computer
	  that PCMCIA cards are plugged into.

	  To use your PC-cards, you will need supporting software from David
	  Hinds' pcmcia-cs package (see the file <file:Documentation/Changes>
	  for location).

	  If unsure, say Y.

config CARDBUS
	bool
	depends on YENTA
	default y if YENTA

config I82092
	tristate "i82092 compatible bridge support"
	depends on PCMCIA && PCI
	help
	  This provides support for the Intel I82092AA PCI-to-PCMCIA bridge device,
	  found in some older laptops and more commonly in evaluation boards for the
	  chip.

config I82365
	tristate "i82365 compatible bridge support"
	depends on PCMCIA && ISA
	help
	  Say Y here to include support for ISA-bus PCMCIA host bridges that
	  are register compatible with the Intel i82365.  These are found on
	  older laptops and ISA-bus card readers for desktop systems.  A
	  "bridge" is the hardware inside your computer that PCMCIA cards are
	  plugged into. If unsure, say N.

config TCIC
	tristate "Databook TCIC host bridge support"
	depends on PCMCIA
	help
	  Say Y here to include support for the Databook TCIC family of PCMCIA
	  host bridges. These are only found on a handful of old systems.
	  "Bridge" is the name used for the hardware inside your computer that
	  PCMCIA cards are plugged into. If unsure, say N.

	depends on HD64465 && PCMCIA

config PCMCIA_SA1100
	tristate "SA1100 support"
	depends on ARM && ARCH_SA1100 && PCMCIA
	help
	  Say Y here to include support for SA11x0-based PCMCIA or CF
	  sockets, found on HP iPAQs, Yopy, and other StrongARM(R)/
	  Xscale(R) embedded machines.

	  This driver is also available as a module called sa1100_cs.

config PCMCIA_SA1111
	tristate "SA1111 support"
	depends on ARM && ARCH_SA1100 && SA1111 && PCMCIA
	help
	  Say Y  here to include support for SA1111-based PCMCIA or CF
	  sockets, found on the Jornada 720, Graphicsmaster and other
	  StrongARM(R)/Xscale(R) embedded machines.

	  This driver is also available as a module called sa1111_cs.

config PCMCIA_PXA2XX
	tristate "PXA2xx support"
	depends on ARM && ARCH_PXA && PCMCIA
	help
	  Say Y here to include support for the PXA2xx PCMCIA controller


config PCMCIA_PROBE
