config SERIO
	tristate "Serial i/o support (needed for keyboard and mouse)"
	default y
	---help---
	  Say Yes here if you have any input device that uses serial I/O to
	  communicate with the system. This includes the 
	  		* standard AT keyboard and PS/2 mouse *
	  as well as serial mice, Sun keyboards, some joysticks and 6dof
	  devices and more.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called serio. If you want to compile it
	  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

	tristate "i8042 PC Keyboard controller"
	default y
	depends on SERIO
	---help---
	  i8042 is the chip over which the standard AT keyboard and PS/2
	  mouse are connected to the computer. If you use these devices,
	  you'll need to say Y here.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called i8042. If you want to compile it

config SERIO_SERPORT
	tristate "Serial port line discipline"
	default y
	depends on SERIO
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you plan to use an input device (mouse, joystick,
	  tablet, 6dof) that communicates over the RS232 serial (COM) port.

	  More information is available: <file:Documentation/input/input.txt>

config SERIO_RPCKBD
	tristate "Acorn RiscPC keyboard controller"
	depends on ARCH_ACORN && SERIO
	default y
	help
	  Say Y here if you have the Acorn RiscPC and want to use an AT
	  keyboard connected to its keyboard controller.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
