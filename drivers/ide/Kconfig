config BLK_DEV_IDE
	tristate "Enhanced IDE/MFM/RLL disk/cdrom/tape/floppy support"
	depends on IDE
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, you will use the full-featured IDE driver to
	  control up to ten ATA/IDE interfaces, each being able to serve a
	  "master" and a "slave" device, for a total of up to twenty ATA/IDE
	  disk/cdrom/tape/floppy drives.

	  Useful information about large (>540 MB) IDE disks, multiple
	  interfaces, what to do if ATA/IDE devices are not automatically
	  detected, sound card ATA/IDE ports, module support, and other
	  topics, is contained in <file:Documentation/ide.txt>. For detailed
	  information about hard drives, consult the Disk-HOWTO and the
	  Multi-Disk-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To fine-tune ATA/IDE drive/interface parameters for improved
	  performance, look for the hdparm package at
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/hardware/>.

	  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> and
	  <file:Documentation/ide.txt>. The module will be called ide-mod.
	  Do not compile this driver as a module if your root file system (the
	  one containing the directory /) is located on an IDE device.

	  If you have one or more IDE drives, say Y or M here. If your system
	  has no IDE drives, or if memory requirements are really tight, you
	  could say N here, and select the "Old hard disk driver" below
	  instead to save about 13 KB of memory in the kernel.

	---help---
	  There are two drivers for MFM/RLL/IDE disks.  Most people use just
	  the new enhanced driver by itself.  This option however installs the
	  old hard disk driver to control the primary IDE/disk interface in
	  the system, leaving the new enhanced IDE driver to take care of only
	  the 2nd/3rd/4th IDE interfaces.  Doing this will prevent you from
	  having an IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM or tape drive connected to the primary
	  IDE interface.  Choosing this option may be useful for older systems
	  which have MFM/RLL/ESDI controller+drives at the primary port
	  address (0x1f0), along with IDE drives at the secondary/3rd/4th port
	  addresses.

	  Normally, just say N here; you will then use the new driver for all
	  4 interfaces.

	help
	  Should you have a system w/ an AWARD Bios and your drives are larger

	  operations first.  The option is called "STROKE" because it allows
	  one to "soft clip" the drive to work around a barrier limit.  For
	  Maxtor drives it is called "jumpon.exe".  Please search Maxtor's
	  web-site for "JUMPON.EXE".  IBM has a similar tool at:

config BLK_DEV_IDECD
	tristate "Include IDE/ATAPI CDROM support"
	depends on BLK_DEV_IDE
	---help---
	  If you have a CD-ROM drive using the ATAPI protocol, say Y. ATAPI is
	  a newer protocol used by IDE CD-ROM and TAPE drives, similar to the
	  SCSI protocol. Most new CD-ROM drives use ATAPI, including the
	  NEC-260, Mitsumi FX400, Sony 55E, and just about all non-SCSI
	  double(2X) or better speed drives.

	  If you say Y here, the CD-ROM drive will be identified at boot time
	  along with other IDE devices, as "hdb" or "hdc", or something
	  similar (check the boot messages with dmesg). If this is your only
	  CD-ROM drive, you can say N to all other CD-ROM options, but be sure
	  to say Y or M to "ISO 9660 CD-ROM file system support".

	  Note that older versions of LILO (LInux LOader) cannot properly deal
	  with IDE/ATAPI CD-ROMs, so install LILO 16 or higher, available from
	  <ftp://brun.dyndns.org/pub/linux/lilo/>.

	  If you want to compile the driver as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),

	---help---
	  If you have an IDE floppy drive which uses the ATAPI protocol,
	  answer Y.  ATAPI is a newer protocol used by IDE CD-ROM/tape/floppy
	  drives, similar to the SCSI protocol.

	  The LS-120 and the IDE/ATAPI Iomega ZIP drive are also supported by
	  this driver. For information about jumper settings and the question
	  of when a ZIP drive uses a partition table, see
	  <http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/zip/zip-1.html>.
	  (ATAPI PD-CD/CDR drives are not supported by this driver; support
	  for PD-CD/CDR drives is available if you answer Y to
	  "SCSI emulation support", below).

	  If you say Y here, the FLOPPY drive will be identified along with
	  other IDE devices, as "hdb" or "hdc", or something similar (check

config BLK_DEV_IDESCSI
	tristate "SCSI emulation support"
	depends on BLK_DEV_IDE && SCSI
	---help---
	  This will provide SCSI host adapter emulation for IDE ATAPI devices,
	  and will allow you to use a SCSI device driver instead of a native
	  ATAPI driver.

	  This is useful if you have an ATAPI device for which no native
	  driver has been written (for example, an ATAPI PD-CD or CDR drive);
	  you can then use this emulation together with an appropriate SCSI
	  device driver. In order to do this, say Y here and to "SCSI support"
	  and "SCSI generic support", below. You must then provide the kernel
	  command line "hdx=ide-scsi" (try "man bootparam" or see the
	  documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to
	  pass options to the kernel at boot time) for devices if you want the
	  native EIDE sub-drivers to skip over the native support, so that
	  this SCSI emulation can be used instead. This is required for use of
	  CD-RW's.

	  Note that this option does NOT allow you to attach SCSI devices to a
	  box that doesn't have a SCSI host adapter installed.

	  If both this SCSI emulation and native ATAPI support are compiled
	  into the kernel, the native support will be used.

config IDE_TASK_IOCTL

	help
	  This is a direct raw access to the media.  It is a complex but
	  elegant solution to test and validate the domain of the hardware and

config BLK_DEV_CMD640
	bool "CMD640 chipset bugfix/support"
	depends on BLK_DEV_IDE && X86
	---help---
	  The CMD-Technologies CMD640 IDE chip is used on many common 486 and
	  Pentium motherboards, usually in combination with a "Neptune" or
	  "SiS" chipset. Unfortunately, it has a number of rather nasty
	  design flaws that can cause severe data corruption under many common
	  conditions. Say Y here to include code which tries to automatically
	  detect and correct the problems under Linux. This option also
	  enables access to the secondary IDE ports in some CMD640 based
	  systems.

	  This driver will work automatically in PCI based systems (most new
	  systems have PCI slots). But if your system uses VESA local bus
	  (VLB) instead of PCI, you must also supply a kernel boot parameter
	  to enable the CMD640 bugfix/support: "ide0=cmd640_vlb". (Try "man
	  bootparam" or see the documentation of your boot loader about how to
	  pass options to the kernel.)

	  The CMD640 chip is also used on add-in cards by Acculogic, and on
	  the "CSA-6400E PCI to IDE controller" that some people have. For
	  details, read <file:Documentation/ide.txt>.

config BLK_DEV_CMD640_ENHANCED
	bool "CMD640 enhanced support"
	depends on BLK_DEV_CMD640
	help
	  This option includes support for setting/autotuning PIO modes and
	  prefetch on CMD640 IDE interfaces.  For details, read
	  <file:Documentation/ide.txt>. If you have a CMD640 IDE interface
	  and your BIOS does not already do this for you, then say Y here.
	  Otherwise say N.

config BLK_DEV_IDEPNP

	help
	  Some ATA/IDE chipsets have hardware support which allows for
	  sharing a single IRQ with other cards. To enable support for
	  this in the ATA/IDE driver, say Y here.

	  It is safe to say Y to this question, in most cases.
	  If unsure, say N.

config BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI
	bool "Generic PCI bus-master DMA support"
	depends on PCI && BLK_DEV_IDEPCI
	---help---
	  If your PCI system uses IDE drive(s) (as opposed to SCSI, say) and
	  is capable of bus-master DMA operation (most Pentium PCI systems),
	  you will want to say Y here to reduce CPU overhead. You can then use
	  the "hdparm" utility to enable DMA for drives for which it was not
	  enabled automatically. By default, DMA is not enabled automatically
	  for these drives, but you can change that by saying Y to the
	  following question "Use DMA by default when available". You can get
	  the latest version of the hdparm utility from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/hardware/>.

	  Read the comments at the beginning of <file:drivers/ide/ide-dma.c>
	  and the file <file:Documentation/ide.txt> for more information.

	  It is safe to say Y to this question.

config BLK_DEV_IDE_TCQ
	bool "ATA tagged command queueing (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Support for tagged command queueing on ATA disk drives. This enables
	  the IDE layer to have multiple in-flight requests on hardware that
	  supports it. For now this includes the IBM Deskstar series drives,
	  such as the 22GXP, 75GXP, 40GV, 60GXP, and 120GXP (ie any Deskstar made
	  in the last couple of years), and at least some of the Western
	  Digital drives in the Expert series (by nature of really being IBM
	  drives).

	  If you have such a drive, say Y here.

config BLK_DEV_IDE_TCQ_DEFAULT
	bool "TCQ on by default"
	depends on BLK_DEV_IDE_TCQ
	---help---
	  Enable tagged command queueing unconditionally on drives that report
	  support for it. Regardless of the chosen value here, tagging can be
	  controlled at run time:

	  echo "using_tcq:32" > /proc/ide/hdX/settings

	  where any value between 1-32 selects chosen queue depth and enables
	  TCQ, and 0 disables it. hdparm version 4.7 an above also support
	  TCQ manipulations.

	  Generally say Y here.

config BLK_DEV_IDE_TCQ_DEPTH
	int "Default queue depth"

	default "8"
	help
	  Maximum size of commands to enable per-drive. Any value between 1
	  and 32 is valid, with 32 being the maxium that the hardware supports.

	  You probably just want the default of 32 here. If you enter an invalid

config BLK_DEV_OFFBOARD
	bool "Boot off-board chipsets first support"
	depends on PCI && BLK_DEV_IDEPCI
	---help---
	  Normally, IDE controllers built into the motherboard (on-board
	  controllers) are assigned to ide0 and ide1 while those on add-in PCI
	  cards (off-board controllers) are relegated to ide2 and ide3.
	  Answering Y here will allow you to reverse the situation, with
	  off-board controllers on ide0/1 and on-board controllers on ide2/3.
	  This can improve the usability of some boot managers such as lilo
	  when booting from a drive on an off-board controller.

	  If you say Y here, and you actually want to reverse the device scan
	  order as explained above, you also need to issue the kernel command
	  line option "ide=reverse". (Try "man bootparam" or see the
	  documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to
	  pass options to the kernel at boot time.)

	  Note that, if you do this, the order of the hd* devices will be

	depends on BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI
	---help---
	  Prior to kernel version 2.1.112, Linux used to automatically use
	  DMA for IDE drives and chipsets which support it. Due to concerns
	  about a couple of cases where buggy hardware may have caused damage,
	  the default is now to NOT use DMA automatically. To revert to the
	  previous behaviour, say Y to this question.

	  If you suspect your hardware is at all flakey, say N here.
	  Do NOT email the IDE kernel people regarding this issue!

	  It is normally safe to answer Y to this question unless your

	  There are two drivers for MFM/RLL/IDE hard disks. Most people use
