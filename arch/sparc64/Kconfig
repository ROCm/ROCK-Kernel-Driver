config BBC_I2C
	tristate "UltraSPARC-III bootbus i2c controller driver"
	depends on PCI
	help
	  The BBC devices on the UltraSPARC III have two I2C controllers.  The
	  first I2C controller connects mainly to configuration PROMs (NVRAM,
	  CPU configuration, DIMM types, etc.).  The second I2C controller
	  connects to environmental control devices such as fans and
	  temperature sensors.  The second controller also connects to the
	  smartcard reader, if present.  Say Y to enable support for these.

config VT
	bool "Virtual terminal" if EMBEDDED
	select INPUT
	default y
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, you will get support for terminal devices with
	  display and keyboard devices. These are called "virtual" because you
	  can run several virtual terminals (also called virtual consoles) on
	  one physical terminal. This is rather useful, for example one
	  virtual terminal can collect system messages and warnings, another
	  one can be used for a text-mode user session, and a third could run
	  an X session, all in parallel. Switching between virtual terminals
	  is done with certain key combinations, usually Alt-<function key>.

	  The setterm command ("man setterm") can be used to change the
	  properties (such as colors or beeping) of a virtual terminal. The
	  man page console_codes(4) ("man console_codes") contains the special
	  character sequences that can be used to change those properties
	  directly. The fonts used on virtual terminals can be changed with
	  the setfont ("man setfont") command and the key bindings are defined
	  with the loadkeys ("man loadkeys") command.

	  You need at least one virtual terminal device in order to make use
	  of your keyboard and monitor. Therefore, only people configuring an
	  embedded system would want to say N here in order to save some
	  memory; the only way to log into such a system is then via a serial
	  or network connection.

	  If unsure, say Y, or else you won't be able to do much with your new
	  shiny Linux system :-)

config VT_CONSOLE
	bool "Support for console on virtual terminal" if EMBEDDED
	depends on VT
	default y
	---help---
	  The system console is the device which receives all kernel messages
	  and warnings and which allows logins in single user mode. If you
	  answer Y here, a virtual terminal (the device used to interact with
	  a physical terminal) can be used as system console. This is the most
	  common mode of operations, so you should say Y here unless you want
	  the kernel messages be output only to a serial port (in which case
	  you should say Y to "Console on serial port", below).

	  If you do say Y here, by default the currently visible virtual
	  terminal (/dev/tty0) will be used as system console. You can change
	  that with a kernel command line option such as "console=tty3" which
	  would use the third virtual terminal as system console. (Try "man
	  bootparam" or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or
	  loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)

	  If unsure, say Y.

config HW_CONSOLE
	bool
	default y

config SMP
	bool "Symmetric multi-processing support"
	---help---
	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
	  a system with only one CPU, like most personal computers, say N. If
	  you have a system with more than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
	  singleprocessor machines. On a singleprocessor machine, the kernel
	  will run faster if you say N here.

	  Note that if you say Y here and choose architecture "586" or
	  "Pentium" under "Processor family", the kernel will not work on 486
	  architectures. Similarly, multiprocessor kernels for the "PPro"
	  architecture may not work on all Pentium based boards.

	  People using multiprocessor machines who say Y here should also say
	  Y to "Enhanced Real Time Clock Support", below. The "Advanced Power
	  Management" code will be disabled if you say Y here.

	  See also the <file:Documentation/smp.tex>,
	  <file:Documentation/smp.txt>, <file:Documentation/i386/IO-APIC.txt>,
	  <file:Documentation/nmi_watchdog.txt> and the SMP-HOWTO available at
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say N.

config PREEMPT
	bool "Preemptible Kernel"
	help
	  This option reduces the latency of the kernel when reacting to
	  real-time or interactive events by allowing a low priority process to
	  be preempted even if it is in kernel mode executing a system call.
	  This allows applications to run more reliably even when the system is
	  under load.

	  Say Y here if you are building a kernel for a desktop, embedded
	  or real-time system.  Say N if you are unsure.

config NR_CPUS
	int "Maximum number of CPUs (2-64)"
	depends on SMP
	default "64"

config CPU_FREQ
	bool "CPU Frequency scaling"
	help
	  Clock scaling allows you to change the clock speed of CPUs on the
	  fly.  Currently there are only sparc64 drivers for UltraSPARC-III
	  and UltraSPARC-IIe processors.

	  For details, take a look at linux/Documentation/cpufreq. 

	  If in doubt, say N.

config CPU_FREQ_TABLE
       tristate "CPU frequency table helpers"
       depends on CPU_FREQ
       default y
       help
         Many CPUFreq drivers use these helpers, so only say N here if
	 the CPUFreq driver of your choice doesn't need these helpers.

	 If in doubt, say Y.

config US3_FREQ
	tristate "UltraSPARC-III CPU Frequency driver"
	depends on CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	help
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for UltraSPARC-III processors.

	  For details, take a look at linux/Documentation/cpufreq. 

	  If in doubt, say N.

config US2E_FREQ
	tristate "UltraSPARC-IIe CPU Frequency driver"

# Identify this as a Sparc64 build
config SPARC64
	bool
	default y
	help
	  SPARC is a family of RISC microprocessors designed and marketed by
	  Sun Microsystems, incorporated.  This port covers the newer 64-bit
	  UltraSPARC.  The UltraLinux project maintains both the SPARC32 and
	  SPARC64 ports; its web page is available at
	  <http://www.ultralinux.org/>.

config HOTPLUG
	bool "Support for hot-pluggable devices"
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to plug devices into your computer while
	  the system is running, and be able to use them quickly.  In many
	  cases, the devices can likewise be unplugged at any time too.

	  One well known example of this is PCMCIA- or PC-cards, credit-card
	  size devices such as network cards, modems or hard drives which are
	  plugged into slots found on all modern laptop computers.  Another
	  example, used on modern desktops as well as laptops, is USB.

	  Enable HOTPLUG and KMOD, and build a modular kernel.  Get agent
	  software (at <http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/>) and install it.
	  Then your kernel will automatically call out to a user mode "policy
	  agent" (/sbin/hotplug) to load modules and set up software needed
	  to use devices as you hotplug them.

config ISA
	bool
	help
	  Find out whether you have ISA slots on your motherboard.  ISA is the
	  name of a bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff
	  inside your box.  Other bus systems are PCI, EISA, MicroChannel
	  (MCA) or VESA.  ISA is an older system, now being displaced by PCI;
	  newer boards don't support it.  If you have ISA, say Y, otherwise N.

config ISAPNP
	bool
	help
	  Say Y here if you would like support for ISA Plug and Play devices.
	  Some information is in <file:Documentation/isapnp.txt>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called isapnp.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config EISA
	bool
	---help---
	  The Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) bus was
	  developed as an open alternative to the IBM MicroChannel bus.

	  The EISA bus provided some of the features of the IBM MicroChannel
	  bus while maintaining backward compatibility with cards made for
	  the older ISA bus.  The EISA bus saw limited use between 1988 and
	  1995 when it was made obsolete by the PCI bus.

	  Say Y here if you are building a kernel for an EISA-based machine.

	  Otherwise, say N.

config MCA
	bool
	help
	  MicroChannel Architecture is found in some IBM PS/2 machines and
	  laptops.  It is a bus system similar to PCI or ISA. See
	  <file:Documentation/mca.txt> (and especially the web page given
	  there) before attempting to build an MCA bus kernel.

config PCMCIA
	tristate
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to attach PCMCIA- or PC-cards to your Linux
	  computer.  These are credit-card size devices such as network cards,
	  modems or hard drives often used with laptops computers.  There are
	  actually two varieties of these cards: the older 16 bit PCMCIA cards
	  and the newer 32 bit CardBus cards.  If you want to use CardBus
	  cards, you need to say Y here and also to "CardBus support" below.

	  To use your PC-cards, you will need supporting software from David
	  Hinds' pcmcia-cs package (see the file <file:Documentation/Changes>
	  for location).  Please also read the PCMCIA-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as modules, choose M here: the
	  modules will be called pcmcia_core and ds.

config PCI
	bool "PCI support"
	help
	  Find out whether you have a PCI motherboard. PCI is the name of a
	  bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff inside
	  your box. Other bus systems are ISA, EISA, MicroChannel (MCA) or
	  VESA. If you have PCI, say Y, otherwise N.

	  The PCI-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, contains valuable
	  information about which PCI hardware does work under Linux and which
	  doesn't.

config PCI_DOMAINS
	bool
	default PCI

config RTC
	tristate
	depends on PCI
	default y
	---help---
	  If you say Y here and create a character special file /dev/rtc with
	  major number 10 and minor number 135 using mknod ("man mknod"), you
	  will get access to the real time clock (or hardware clock) built
	  into your computer.

	  Every PC has such a clock built in. It can be used to generate
	  signals from as low as 1Hz up to 8192Hz, and can also be used
	  as a 24 hour alarm. It reports status information via the file
	  /proc/driver/rtc and its behaviour is set by various ioctls on
	  /dev/rtc.

	  If you run Linux on a multiprocessor machine and said Y to
	  "Symmetric Multi Processing" above, you should say Y here to read
	  and set the RTC in an SMP compatible fashion.

	  If you think you have a use for such a device (such as periodic data
	  sampling), then say Y here, and read <file:Documentation/rtc.txt>
	  for details.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called rtc.

source "drivers/pci/Kconfig"

config SUN_OPENPROMFS
	tristate "Openprom tree appears in /proc/openprom"
	help
	  If you say Y, the OpenPROM device tree will be available as a
	  virtual file system, which you can mount to /proc/openprom by "mount
	  -t openpromfs none /proc/openprom".

	  To compile the /proc/openprom support as a module, choose M here: the

	  or other a.out binaries, say Y. If unsure, say N.

source "fs/Kconfig.binfmt"

config SUNOS_EMUL
	bool "SunOS binary emulation"
	help
	  This allows you to run most SunOS binaries.  If you want to do this,
	  say Y here and place appropriate files in /usr/gnemul/sunos. See
	  <http://www.ultralinux.org/faq.html> for more information.  If you
	  want to run SunOS binaries on an Ultra you must also say Y to

config PRINTER
	tristate "Parallel printer support"
	depends on PARPORT
	---help---
	  If you intend to attach a printer to the parallel port of your Linux
	  box (as opposed to using a serial printer; if the connector at the
	  printer has 9 or 25 holes ["female"], then it's serial), say Y.
	  Also read the Printing-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  It is possible to share one parallel port among several devices
	  (e.g. printer and ZIP drive) and it is safe to compile the
	  corresponding drivers into the kernel.
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/parport.txt>.  The module will be called lp.

	  If you have several parallel ports, you can specify which ports to
	  use with the "lp" kernel command line option.  (Try "man bootparam"
	  or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about
	  how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)  The syntax of the
	  "lp" command line option can be found in <file:drivers/char/lp.c>.

	  If you have more than 8 printers, you need to increase the LP_NO
	  macro in lp.c and the PARPORT_MAX macro in parport.h.

config ENVCTRL
	tristate "SUNW, envctrl support"
	depends on PCI
	help
	  Kernel support for temperature and fan monitoring on Sun SME
	  machines.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  This is the driver for the 7-segment display and LED present on
	  Sun Microsystems CompactPCI models CP1400 and CP1500.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called display7seg.

	  If you do not have a CompactPCI model CP1400 or CP1500, or
	  another UltraSPARC-IIi-cEngine boardset with a 7-segment display,
	  you should say N to this option.

config WATCHDOG_CP1XXX
	tristate "CP1XXX Hardware Watchdog support"
	depends on PCI
	---help---
	  This is the driver for the hardware watchdog timers present on
	  Sun Microsystems CompactPCI models CP1400 and CP1500.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called cpwatchdog.

	  If you do not have a CompactPCI model CP1400 or CP1500, or
	  another UltraSPARC-IIi-cEngine boardset with hardware watchdog,
	  you should say N to this option.

config WATCHDOG_RIO
	tristate "RIO Hardware Watchdog support"
	depends on PCI
	help
	  Say Y here to support the hardware watchdog capability on Sun RIO

config BLK_DEV_FD
	bool "Normal floppy disk support"
	---help---
	  If you want to use the floppy disk drive(s) of your PC under Linux,
	  say Y. Information about this driver, especially important for IBM
	  Thinkpad users, is contained in <file:Documentation/floppy.txt>.
	  That file also contains the location of the Floppy driver FAQ as
	  well as location of the fdutils package used to configure additional
	  parameters of the driver at run time.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called floppy.

config BLK_DEV_LOOP
	tristate "Loopback device support"
	---help---
	  Saying Y here will allow you to use a regular file as a block
	  device; you can then create a file system on that block device and
	  mount it just as you would mount other block devices such as hard
	  drive partitions, CD-ROM drives or floppy drives. The loop devices
	  are block special device files with major number 7 and typically
	  called /dev/loop0, /dev/loop1 etc.

	  This is useful if you want to check an ISO 9660 file system before
	  burning the CD, or if you want to use floppy images without first
	  writing them to floppy. Furthermore, some Linux distributions avoid
	  the need for a dedicated Linux partition by keeping their complete
	  root file system inside a DOS FAT file using this loop device
	  driver.

	  The loop device driver can also be used to "hide" a file system in a
	  disk partition, floppy, or regular file, either using encryption
	  (scrambling the data) or steganography (hiding the data in the low
	  bits of, say, a sound file). This is also safe if the file resides
	  on a remote file server. If you want to do this, you will first have
	  to acquire and install a kernel patch from
	  <ftp://ftp.kerneli.org/pub/kerneli/>, and then you need to
	  say Y to this option.

	  Note that alternative ways to use encrypted file systems are
	  provided by the cfs package, which can be gotten from
	  <ftp://ftp.kerneli.org/pub/kerneli/net-source/>, and the newer tcfs
	  package, available at <http://tcfs.dia.unisa.it/>. You do not need
	  to say Y here if you want to use one of these. However, using cfs
	  requires saying Y to "NFS file system support" below while using
	  tcfs requires applying a kernel patch. An alternative steganography
	  solution is provided by StegFS, also available from
	  <ftp://ftp.kerneli.org/pub/kerneli/net-source/>.

	  To use the loop device, you need the losetup utility and a recent
	  version of the mount program, both contained in the util-linux
	  package. The location and current version number of util-linux is
	  contained in the file <file:Documentation/Changes>.

	  Note that this loop device has nothing to do with the loopback
	  device used for network connections from the machine to itself.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called loop.

	  Most users will answer N here.

config BLK_DEV_NBD
	tristate "Network block device support"

	---help---
	  Saying Y here will allow your computer to be a client for network
	  block devices, i.e. it will be able to use block devices exported by
	  servers (mount file systems on them etc.). Communication between
	  client and server works over TCP/IP networking, but to the client
	  program this is hidden: it looks like a regular local file access to
	  a block device special file such as /dev/nd0.

	  Network block devices also allows you to run a block-device in
	  userland (making server and client physically the same computer,
	  communicating using the loopback network device).

	  Read <file:Documentation/nbd.txt> for more information, especially
	  about where to find the server code, which runs in user space and
	  does not need special kernel support.

	  Note that this has nothing to do with the network file systems NFS
	  or Coda; you can say N here even if you intend to use NFS or Coda.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

	  write to it and do all the other things that you can do with normal
	  block devices (such as hard drives). It is usually used to load and
	  store a copy of a minimal root file system off of a floppy into RAM
	  during the initial install of Linux.

	  Note that the kernel command line option "ramdisk=XX" is now
	  obsolete. For details, read <file:Documentation/ramdisk.txt>.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

config UNIX98_PTYS
	bool "Unix98 PTY support"
	---help---
	  A pseudo terminal (PTY) is a software device consisting of two
	  halves: a master and a slave. The slave device behaves identical to
	  a physical terminal; the master device is used by a process to
	  read data from and write data to the slave, thereby emulating a
	  terminal. Typical programs for the master side are telnet servers
	  and xterms.

	  Linux has traditionally used the BSD-like names /dev/ptyxx for
	  masters and /dev/ttyxx for slaves of pseudo terminals. This scheme
	  has a number of problems. The GNU C library glibc 2.1 and later,
	  however, supports the Unix98 naming standard: in order to acquire a
	  pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo
	  terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo
	  terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/<number>. What was
	  traditionally /dev/ttyp2 will then be /dev/pts/2, for example.

	  The entries in /dev/pts/ are created on the fly by a virtual
	  file system; therefore, if you say Y here you should say Y to
	  "/dev/pts file system for Unix98 PTYs" as well.

	  If you want to say Y here, you need to have the C library glibc 2.1
	  or later (equal to libc-6.1, check with "ls -l /lib/libc.so.*").

	help
	  Kernel-level support for the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI)
	  introduced in XFree86 4.0. If you say Y here, you need to select
	  the module that's right for your graphics card from the list below.
	  These modules provide support for synchronization, security, and
	  DMA transfers. Please see <http://dri.sourceforge.net/> for more
	  details.  You should also select and configure AGP
	  (/dev/agpgart) support.

config DRM_FFB
	tristate "Creator/Creator3D"
	depends on DRM
	help
	  Choose this option if you have one of Sun's Creator3D-based graphics
	  and frame buffer cards.  Product page at
	  <http://www.sun.com/desktop/products/Graphics/creator3d.html>.

config DRM_TDFX
	tristate "3dfx Banshee/Voodoo3+"
	depends on DRM
	help
	  Choose this option if you have a 3dfx Banshee or Voodoo3 (or later),
	  graphics card.  If M is selected, the module will be called tdfx.

config DRM_R128
	tristate "ATI Rage 128"
	depends on DRM
	help
	  Choose this option if you have an ATI Rage 128 graphics card.  If M
	  is selected, the module will be called r128.  AGP support for
	  this card is strongly suggested (unless you have a PCI version).

config SOFT_WATCHDOG
	tristate "Software watchdog"
	help
	  A software monitoring watchdog. This will fail to reboot your system
	  from some situations that the hardware watchdog will recover
	  from. Equally it's a lot cheaper to install.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called softdog.

config DEBUG_KERNEL
	bool "Kernel debugging"
	help
	  Say Y here if you are developing drivers or trying to debug and
	  identify kernel problems.

config DEBUG_SLAB
	bool "Debug memory allocations"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Say Y here to have the kernel do limited verification on memory
	  allocation as well as poisoning memory on free to catch use of freed
	  memory.

config MAGIC_SYSRQ
	bool "Magic SysRq key"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will have some control over the system even
	  if the system crashes for example during kernel debugging (e.g., you
	  will be able to flush the buffer cache to disk, reboot the system
	  immediately or dump some status information). This is accomplished
	  by pressing various keys while holding SysRq (Alt+PrintScreen). It
	  also works on a serial console (on PC hardware at least), if you
	  send a BREAK and then within 5 seconds a command keypress. The
	  keys are documented in <file:Documentation/sysrq.txt>. Don't say Y
	  unless you really know what this hack does.

config DEBUG_SPINLOCK
	bool "Spinlock debugging"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Say Y here and build SMP to catch missing spinlock initialization
	  and certain other kinds of spinlock errors commonly made.  This is
	  best used in conjunction with the NMI watchdog so that spinlock
	  deadlocks are also debuggable.

# We have a custom atomic_dec_and_lock() implementation but it's not
# compatible with spinlock debugging so we need to fall back on
# the generic version in that case.
config HAVE_DEC_LOCK
	bool
	depends on SMP && !DEBUG_SPINLOCK
	default y

config DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP
	bool "Sleep-inside-spinlock checking"
	help
	  If you say Y here, various routines which may sleep will become very
	  noisy if they are called with a spinlock held.	

config DEBUG_BUGVERBOSE
	bool "Verbose BUG() reporting (adds 70K)"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Say Y here to make BUG() panics output the file name and line number
	  of the BUG call as well as the EIP and oops trace.  This aids
	  debugging but costs about 70-100K of memory.

config DEBUG_DCFLUSH
	bool "D-cache flush debugging"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL

config DEBUG_INFO
	bool "Compile the kernel with debug info"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
          If you say Y here the resulting kernel image will include
	  debugging info resulting in a larger kernel image.
	  Say Y here only if you plan to use gdb to debug the kernel.
	  If you don't debug the kernel, you can say N.
