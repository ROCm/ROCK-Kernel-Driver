config BBC_I2C
	tristate "UltraSPARC-III bootbus i2c controller driver"
	help
	  The BBC devices on the UltraSPARC III have two I2C controllers.  The
	  first I2C controller connects mainly to configuration PROMs (NVRAM,
	  CPU configuration, DIMM types, etc.).  The second I2C controller
	  connects to environmental control devices such as fans and
	  temperature sensors.  The second controller also connects to the
	  smartcard reader, if present.  Say Y to enable support for these.

config VT
	bool
	default y
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, you will get support for terminal devices with
	  display and keyboard devices. These are called "virtual" because you
	  can run several virtual terminals (also called virtual consoles) on
	  one physical terminal. This is rather useful, for example one
	  virtual terminal can collect system messages and warnings, another
	  one can be used for a text-mode user session, and a third could run
	  an X session, all in parallel. Switching between virtual terminals
	  is done with certain key combinations, usually Alt-<function key>.

	  The setterm command ("man setterm") can be used to change the
	  properties (such as colors or beeping) of a virtual terminal. The
	  man page console_codes(4) ("man console_codes") contains the special
	  character sequences that can be used to change those properties
	  directly. The fonts used on virtual terminals can be changed with
	  the setfont ("man setfont") command and the key bindings are defined
	  with the loadkeys ("man loadkeys") command.

	  You need at least one virtual terminal device in order to make use
	  of your keyboard and monitor. Therefore, only people configuring an
	  embedded system would want to say N here in order to save some
	  memory; the only way to log into such a system is then via a serial
	  or network connection.

	  If unsure, say Y, or else you won't be able to do much with your new
	  shiny Linux system :-)

config VT_CONSOLE
	bool
	default y
	---help---
	  The system console is the device which receives all kernel messages
	  and warnings and which allows logins in single user mode. If you
	  answer Y here, a virtual terminal (the device used to interact with
	  a physical terminal) can be used as system console. This is the most
	  common mode of operations, so you should say Y here unless you want
	  the kernel messages be output only to a serial port (in which case
	  you should say Y to "Console on serial port", below).

	  If you do say Y here, by default the currently visible virtual
	  terminal (/dev/tty0) will be used as system console. You can change
	  that with a kernel command line option such as "console=tty3" which
	  would use the third virtual terminal as system console. (Try "man
	  bootparam" or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or
	  loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)

	  If unsure, say Y.

config HW_CONSOLE
	bool
	default y

config HUGETLB_PAGE
	bool "SPARC64 Huge TLB Page Support"
	help
	  This enables support for huge pages.  User space applications
	  can make use of this support with the sys_alloc_hugepages and
	  sys_free_hugepages system calls.  If your applications are
	  huge page aware, then say Y here.

	  Otherwise, say N.

config SMP
	bool "Symmetric multi-processing support"
	---help---
	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
	  a system with only one CPU, like most personal computers, say N. If
	  you have a system with more than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
	  singleprocessor machines. On a singleprocessor machine, the kernel
	  will run faster if you say N here.

	  Note that if you say Y here and choose architecture "586" or
	  "Pentium" under "Processor family", the kernel will not work on 486
	  architectures. Similarly, multiprocessor kernels for the "PPro"
	  architecture may not work on all Pentium based boards.

	  People using multiprocessor machines who say Y here should also say
	  Y to "Enhanced Real Time Clock Support", below. The "Advanced Power
	  Management" code will be disabled if you say Y here.

	  See also the <file:Documentation/smp.tex>,
	  <file:Documentation/smp.txt>, <file:Documentation/i386/IO-APIC.txt>,
	  <file:Documentation/nmi_watchdog.txt> and the SMP-HOWTO available at
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say N.

config PREEMPT
	bool "Preemptible Kernel"
	help
	  This option reduces the latency of the kernel when reacting to
	  real-time or interactive events by allowing a low priority process to
	  be preempted even if it is in kernel mode executing a system call.
	  This allows applications to run more reliably even when the system is
	  under load.

	  Say Y here if you are building a kernel for a desktop, embedded
	  or real-time system.  Say N if you are unsure.

config NR_CPUS
	int "Maximum number of CPUs (2-64)"
	depends on SMP
	default "64"

config CPU_FREQ
	bool "CPU Frequency scaling"
	help
	  Clock scaling allows you to change the clock speed of CPUs on the
	  fly.  Currently there are only sparc64 drivers for UltraSPARC-III
	  and UltraSPARC-IIe processors.

	  For details, take a look at linux/Documentation/cpufreq. 

	  If in doubt, say N.

config CPU_FREQ_TABLE
       tristate "CPU frequency table helpers"
       depends on CPU_FREQ
       default y
       help
         Many CPUFreq drivers use these helpers, so only say N here if
	 the CPUFreq driver of your choice doesn't need these helpers.

	 If in doubt, say Y.

config US3_FREQ
	tristate "UltraSPARC-III CPU Frequency driver"
	depends on CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	help
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for UltraSPARC-III processors.

	  For details, take a look at linux/Documentation/cpufreq. 

	  If in doubt, say N.

config US2E_FREQ
	tristate "UltraSPARC-IIe CPU Frequency driver"
	depends on CPU_FREQ_TABLE
	help
	  This adds the CPUFreq driver for UltraSPARC-IIe processors.

	  For details, take a look at linux/Documentation/cpufreq. 

	  If in doubt, say N.

# Identify this as a Sparc64 build
config SPARC64
	bool
	default y
	help
	  SPARC is a family of RISC microprocessors designed and marketed by
	  Sun Microsystems, incorporated.  This port covers the newer 64-bit
	  UltraSPARC.  The UltraLinux project maintains both the SPARC32 and
	  SPARC64 ports; its web page is available at
	  <http://www.ultralinux.org/>.

config HOTPLUG
	bool "Support for hot-pluggable devices"
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to plug devices into your computer while
	  the system is running, and be able to use them quickly.  In many
	  cases, the devices can likewise be unplugged at any time too.

	  One well known example of this is PCMCIA- or PC-cards, credit-card
	  size devices such as network cards, modems or hard drives which are
	  plugged into slots found on all modern laptop computers.  Another
	  example, used on modern desktops as well as laptops, is USB.

	  Enable HOTPLUG and KMOD, and build a modular kernel.  Get agent
	  software (at <http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/>) and install it.
	  Then your kernel will automatically call out to a user mode "policy
	  agent" (/sbin/hotplug) to load modules and set up software needed
	  to use devices as you hotplug them.

config GENERIC_ISA_DMA
	bool

config ISA
	bool
	help
	  Find out whether you have ISA slots on your motherboard.  ISA is the
	  name of a bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff
	  inside your box.  Other bus systems are PCI, EISA, MicroChannel
	  (MCA) or VESA.  ISA is an older system, now being displaced by PCI;
	  newer boards don't support it.  If you have ISA, say Y, otherwise N.

config ISAPNP
	bool
	help
	  Say Y here if you would like support for ISA Plug and Play devices.
	  Some information is in <file:Documentation/isapnp.txt>.

	  This support is also available as a module called isapnp ( =
	  code which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
	  whenever you want). If you want to compile it as a module, say M
	  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config EISA
	bool
	---help---
	  The Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) bus was
	  developed as an open alternative to the IBM MicroChannel bus.

	  The EISA bus provided some of the features of the IBM MicroChannel
	  bus while maintaining backward compatibility with cards made for
	  the older ISA bus.  The EISA bus saw limited use between 1988 and
	  1995 when it was made obsolete by the PCI bus.

	  Say Y here if you are building a kernel for an EISA-based machine.

	  Otherwise, say N.

config MCA
	bool
	help
	  MicroChannel Architecture is found in some IBM PS/2 machines and
	  laptops.  It is a bus system similar to PCI or ISA. See
	  <file:Documentation/mca.txt> (and especially the web page given
	  there) before attempting to build an MCA bus kernel.

config PCMCIA
	tristate
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to attach PCMCIA- or PC-cards to your Linux
	  computer.  These are credit-card size devices such as network cards,
	  modems or hard drives often used with laptops computers.  There are
	  actually two varieties of these cards: the older 16 bit PCMCIA cards
	  and the newer 32 bit CardBus cards.  If you want to use CardBus
	  cards, you need to say Y here and also to "CardBus support" below.

	  To use your PC-cards, you will need supporting software from David
	  Hinds' pcmcia-cs package (see the file <file:Documentation/Changes>
	  for location).  Please also read the PCMCIA-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  When compiled this way, there will be modules called pcmcia_core
	  and ds.  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and
	  read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

config SBUS

config SUN_IO
	bool

config PCI
	bool "PCI support"
	help
	  Find out whether you have a PCI motherboard. PCI is the name of a
	  bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff inside
	  your box. Other bus systems are ISA, EISA, MicroChannel (MCA) or
	  VESA. If you have PCI, say Y, otherwise N.

	  The PCI-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, contains valuable
	  information about which PCI hardware does work under Linux and which
	  doesn't.

config RTC
	tristate
	depends on PCI
	default y
	---help---
	  If you say Y here and create a character special file /dev/rtc with
	  major number 10 and minor number 135 using mknod ("man mknod"), you
	  will get access to the real time clock (or hardware clock) built
	  into your computer.

	  Every PC has such a clock built in. It can be used to generate
	  signals from as low as 1Hz up to 8192Hz, and can also be used
	  as a 24 hour alarm. It reports status information via the file
	  /proc/driver/rtc and its behaviour is set by various ioctls on
	  /dev/rtc.

	  If you run Linux on a multiprocessor machine and said Y to
	  "Symmetric Multi Processing" above, you should say Y here to read
	  and set the RTC in an SMP compatible fashion.

	  If you think you have a use for such a device (such as periodic data
	  sampling), then say Y here, and read <file:Documentation/rtc.txt>
	  for details.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module is called rtc. If you want to compile it as a module,
	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

source "drivers/pci/Kconfig"

config SUN_OPENPROMFS
	tristate "Openprom tree appears in /proc/openprom"
	help
	  If you say Y, the OpenPROM device tree will be available as a
	  virtual file system, which you can mount to /proc/openprom by "mount
	  -t openpromfs none /proc/openprom".

	  If you want to compile the /proc/openprom support as a module ( =
	  code which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
	  whenever you want), say M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
	  The module will be called openpromfs.  If unsure, say M.

config KCORE_ELF
	bool
	depends on PROC_FS
	default y
	---help---
	  If you enabled support for /proc file system then the file
	  /proc/kcore will contain the kernel core image. This can be used
	  in gdb:

	  $ cd /usr/src/linux ; gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore

	  You have two choices here: ELF and A.OUT. Selecting ELF will make
	  /proc/kcore appear in ELF core format as defined by the Executable
	  and Linking Format specification. Selecting A.OUT will choose the
	  old "a.out" format which may be necessary for some old versions
	  of binutils or on some architectures.

	  This is especially useful if you have compiled the kernel with the
	  "-g" option to preserve debugging information. It is mainly used
	  for examining kernel data structures on the live kernel so if you
	  don't understand what this means or are not a kernel hacker, just
	  leave it at its default value ELF.

config SPARC32_COMPAT
	bool "Kernel support for Linux/Sparc 32bit binary compatibility"
	help
	  This allows you to run 32-bit binaries on your Ultra.
	  Everybody wants this; say Y.

config COMPAT
	bool
	depends on SPARC32_COMPAT
	default y

config BINFMT_ELF32
	tristate "Kernel support for 32-bit ELF binaries"
	depends on SPARC32_COMPAT
	help
	  This allows you to run 32-bit Linux/ELF binaries on your Ultra.
	  Everybody wants this; say Y.

config BINFMT_AOUT32
	bool "Kernel support for 32-bit (ie. SunOS) a.out binaries"
	depends on SPARC32_COMPAT
	help
	  This allows you to run 32-bit a.out format binaries on your Ultra.
	  If you want to run SunOS binaries (see SunOS binary emulation below)
	  or other a.out binaries, say Y. If unsure, say N.

config BINFMT_ELF
	tristate "Kernel support for 64-bit ELF binaries"
	---help---
	  ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) is a format for libraries and
	  executables used across different architectures and operating
	  systems. Saying Y here will enable your kernel to run ELF binaries
	  and enlarge it by about 13 KB. ELF support under Linux has now all
	  but replaced the traditional Linux a.out formats (QMAGIC and ZMAGIC)
	  because it is portable (this does *not* mean that you will be able
	  to run executables from different architectures or operating systems
	  however) and makes building run-time libraries very easy. Many new
	  executables are distributed solely in ELF format. You definitely
	  want to say Y here.

	  Information about ELF is contained in the ELF HOWTO available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  If you find that after upgrading from Linux kernel 1.2 and saying Y
	  here, you still can't run any ELF binaries (they just crash), then
	  you'll have to install the newest ELF runtime libraries, including
	  ld.so (check the file <file:Documentation/Changes> for location and
	  latest version).

	  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
	  will be called binfmt_elf. Saying M or N here is dangerous because
	  some crucial programs on your system might be in ELF format.

config BINFMT_MISC
	tristate "Kernel support for MISC binaries"
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, it will be possible to plug wrapper-driven binary
	  formats into the kernel. You will like this especially when you use
	  programs that need an interpreter to run like Java, Python or
	  Emacs-Lisp. It's also useful if you often run DOS executables under
	  the Linux DOS emulator DOSEMU (read the DOSEMU-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>). Once you have
	  registered such a binary class with the kernel, you can start one of
	  those programs simply by typing in its name at a shell prompt; Linux
	  will automatically feed it to the correct interpreter.

	  You can do other nice things, too. Read the file
	  <file:Documentation/binfmt_misc.txt> to learn how to use this
	  feature, and <file:Documentation/java.txt> for information about how
	  to include Java support.

	  You must say Y to "/proc file system support" (CONFIG_PROC_FS) to
	  use this part of the kernel.

	  You may say M here for module support and later load the module when
	  you have use for it; the module is called binfmt_misc. If you
	  don't know what to answer at this point, say Y.

config SUNOS_EMUL
	bool "SunOS binary emulation"
	help
	  This allows you to run most SunOS binaries.  If you want to do this,
	  say Y here and place appropriate files in /usr/gnemul/sunos. See
	  <http://www.ultralinux.org/faq.html> for more information.  If you
	  want to run SunOS binaries on an Ultra you must also say Y to
	  "Kernel support for 32-bit a.out binaries" above.

config SOLARIS_EMUL
	tristate "Solaris binary emulation (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  This is experimental code which will enable you to run (many)
	  Solaris binaries on your SPARC Linux machine.

	  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called solaris. If you want to compile it as a
	  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

source "drivers/parport/Kconfig"

config PRINTER
	tristate "Parallel printer support"
	depends on PARPORT
	---help---
	  If you intend to attach a printer to the parallel port of your Linux
	  box (as opposed to using a serial printer; if the connector at the
	  printer has 9 or 25 holes ["female"], then it's serial), say Y.
	  Also read the Printing-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  It is possible to share one parallel port among several devices
	  (e.g. printer and ZIP drive) and it is safe to compile the
	  corresponding drivers into the kernel.  If you want to compile this
	  driver as a module however ( = code which can be inserted in and
	  removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M here and
	  read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> and
	  <file:Documentation/parport.txt>.  The module will be called lp.

	  If you have several parallel ports, you can specify which ports to
	  use with the "lp" kernel command line option.  (Try "man bootparam"
	  or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about
	  how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)  The syntax of the
	  "lp" command line option can be found in <file:drivers/char/lp.c>.

	  If you have more than 8 printers, you need to increase the LP_NO
	  macro in lp.c and the PARPORT_MAX macro in parport.h.

config ENVCTRL
	tristate "SUNW, envctrl support"
	depends on PCI
	help
	  Kernel support for temperature and fan monitoring on Sun SME
	  machines.

	  This code is also available as a module ( = code which can be

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called display7seg. If you want to compile it
	  as a module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

	  If you do not have a CompactPCI model CP1400 or CP1500, or
	  another UltraSPARC-IIi-cEngine boardset with a 7-segment display,
	  you should say N to this option.

config BLK_DEV_FD

	---help---
	  If you want to use the floppy disk drive(s) of your PC under Linux,
	  say Y. Information about this driver, especially important for IBM
	  Thinkpad users, is contained in <file:Documentation/floppy.txt>.
	  That file also contains the location of the Floppy driver FAQ as
	  well as location of the fdutils package used to configure additional
	  parameters of the driver at run time.

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called floppy. If you want to compile it as a
	  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

config BLK_DEV_LOOP
	tristate "Loopback device support"
	---help---
	  Saying Y here will allow you to use a regular file as a block
	  device; you can then create a file system on that block device and
	  mount it just as you would mount other block devices such as hard
	  drive partitions, CD-ROM drives or floppy drives. The loop devices
	  are block special device files with major number 7 and typically
	  called /dev/loop0, /dev/loop1 etc.

	  This is useful if you want to check an ISO 9660 file system before
	  burning the CD, or if you want to use floppy images without first
	  writing them to floppy. Furthermore, some Linux distributions avoid
	  the need for a dedicated Linux partition by keeping their complete
	  root file system inside a DOS FAT file using this loop device
	  driver.

	  The loop device driver can also be used to "hide" a file system in a
	  disk partition, floppy, or regular file, either using encryption
	  (scrambling the data) or steganography (hiding the data in the low
	  bits of, say, a sound file). This is also safe if the file resides
	  on a remote file server. If you want to do this, you will first have
	  to acquire and install a kernel patch from
	  <ftp://ftp.kerneli.org/pub/kerneli/>, and then you need to
	  say Y to this option.

	  Note that alternative ways to use encrypted file systems are
	  provided by the cfs package, which can be gotten from
	  <ftp://ftp.kerneli.org/pub/kerneli/net-source/>, and the newer tcfs
	  package, available at <http://tcfs.dia.unisa.it/>. You do not need
	  to say Y here if you want to use one of these. However, using cfs
	  requires saying Y to "NFS file system support" below while using
	  tcfs requires applying a kernel patch. An alternative steganography
	  solution is provided by StegFS, also available from
	  <ftp://ftp.kerneli.org/pub/kerneli/net-source/>.

	  To use the loop device, you need the losetup utility and a recent
	  version of the mount program, both contained in the util-linux
	  package. The location and current version number of util-linux is
	  contained in the file <file:Documentation/Changes>.

	  Note that this loop device has nothing to do with the loopback
	  device used for network connections from the machine to itself.

	  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module
	  will be called loop.

	  Most users will answer N here.

config BLK_DEV_NBD
	tristate "Network block device support"
	depends on NET
	---help---
	  Saying Y here will allow your computer to be a client for network
	  block devices, i.e. it will be able to use block devices exported by
	  servers (mount file systems on them etc.). Communication between
	  client and server works over TCP/IP networking, but to the client

	  If you say Y here, your kernel will be able to manage low cost mass
	  storage units such as ATA/(E)IDE and ATAPI units. The most common
	  cases are IDE hard drives and ATAPI CD-ROM drives.

	  If your system is pure SCSI and doesn't use these interfaces, you
	  can say N here.

	  Integrated Disk Electronics (IDE aka ATA-1) is a connecting standard
	  for mass storage units such as hard disks. It was designed by
	  Western Digital and Compaq Computer in 1984. It was then named
	  ST506. Quite a number of disks use the IDE interface.

	  AT Attachment (ATA) is the superset of the IDE specifications.
	  ST506 was also called ATA-1.

	  Fast-IDE is ATA-2 (also named Fast ATA), Enhanced IDE (EIDE) is
	  ATA-3. It provides support for larger disks (up to 8.4GB by means of
	  the LBA standard), more disks (4 instead of 2) and for other mass
	  storage units such as tapes and cdrom. UDMA/33 (aka UltraDMA/33) is
	  ATA-4 and provides faster (and more CPU friendly) transfer modes
	  than previous PIO (Programmed processor Input/Output) from previous
	  ATA/IDE standards by means of fast DMA controllers.

	  ATA Packet Interface (ATAPI) is a protocol used by EIDE tape and
	  CD-ROM drives, similar in many respects to the SCSI protocol.

	  SMART IDE (Self Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) was
	  designed in order to prevent data corruption and disk crash by
	  detecting pre hardware failure conditions (heat, access time, and
	  the like...). Disks built since June 1995 may follow this standard.
	  The kernel itself don't manage this; however there are quite a
	  number of user programs such as smart that can query the status of
	  SMART parameters disk.

	  possible, people should use the new Adaptec written driver instead
	  of this one.  This driver will eventually be phased out entirely.

	  This is support for the various aic7xxx based Adaptec SCSI

	  2902, 2910, 293x, 294x, 394x, 3985 and several other PCI and

	  In general, if the controller is based on an Adaptec SCSI controller
	  chip from the aic777x series or the aic78xx series, this driver
	  should work. The only exception is the 7810 which is specifically

	  Note that the AHA2920 SCSI host adapter is *not* supported by this

	  Information on the configuration options for this controller can be

	---help---
	  This option causes the aic7xxx driver to attempt to use Tagged
	  Command Queueing (TCQ) on all devices that claim to support it.

	  TCQ is a feature of SCSI-2 which improves performance: the host
	  adapter can send several SCSI commands to a device's queue even if
	  previous commands haven't finished yet.  Because the device is
	  intelligent, it can optimize its operations (like head positioning)
	  based on its own request queue.  Not all devices implement this
	  correctly.

	  If you say Y here, you can still turn off TCQ on troublesome devices
	  with the use of the tag_info boot parameter.  See the file
	  <file:Documentation/scsi/aic7xxx.txt> for more information on that and
	  other aic7xxx setup commands.  If this option is turned off, you may
	  still enable TCQ on known good devices by use of the tag_info boot
	  parameter.

	  If you are unsure about your devices then it is safest to say N
	  here.

	  However, TCQ can increase performance on some hard drives by as much
	  as 50% or more, so it is recommended that if you say N here, you
	  should at least read the <file:Documentation/scsi/aic7xxx.txt> file so
	  you will know how to enable this option manually should your drives
	  prove to be safe in regards to TCQ.

	  Conversely, certain drives are known to lock up or cause bus resets
	  when TCQ is enabled on them.  If you have a Western Digital
	  Enterprise SCSI drive for instance, then don't even bother to enable
	  TCQ on it as the drive will become unreliable, and it will actually
	  reduce performance.

	  figure. If the number is too high for any particular device, the
	  driver will automatically compensate usually after only 10 minutes
	  of uptime. It will not hinder performance if some of your devices
	  eventually have their command depth reduced, but is a waste of
	  memory if all of your devices end up reducing this number down to a
	  more reasonable figure.

	  NOTE: Certain very broken drives are known to lock up when given
	  more commands than they like to deal with. Quantum Fireball drives

	  NCR53C8XX and this SYM53C8XX drivers either as module or linked to
	  the kernel image.

	  When both drivers are linked into the kernel, the SYM53C8XX driver
	  is called first at initialization and you can use the 'excl=ioaddr'
	  driver boot option to exclude attachment of adapters by the
	  SYM53C8XX driver.  For example, entering
	  'sym53c8xx=excl:0xb400,excl=0xc000' at the lilo prompt prevents
	  adapters at io address 0xb400 and 0xc000 from being attached by the
	  SYM53C8XX driver, thus allowing the NCR53C8XX driver to attach them.
	  The 'excl' option is also supported by the NCR53C8XX driver.

	  Please read <file:Documentation/scsi/ncr53c8xx.txt> for more
	  information.

config SCSI_NCR53C8XX_DEFAULT_TAGS
	int "default tagged command queue depth"
	depends on PCI && SCSI_SYM53C8XX_2!=y && (SCSI_NCR53C8XX || SCSI_SYM53C8XX)
	default "8"
	---help---
	  "Tagged command queuing" is a feature of SCSI-2 which improves
	  performance: the host adapter can send several SCSI commands to a
	  device's queue even if previous commands haven't finished yet.
	  Because the device is intelligent, it can optimize its operations
	  (like head positioning) based on its own request queue. Some SCSI
	  devices don't implement this properly; if you want to disable this
	  feature, enter 0 or 1 here (it doesn't matter which).

	  The default value is 8 and should be supported by most hard disks.
	  This value can be overridden from the boot command line using the
	  'tags' option as follows (example):
	  'ncr53c8xx=tags:4/t2t3q16/t0u2q10' will set default queue depth to
	  4, set queue depth to 16 for target 2 and target 3 on controller 0
	  and set queue depth to 10 for target 0 / lun 2 on controller 1.

	  The normal answer therefore is to go with the default 8 and to use
	  a boot command line option for devices that need to use a different
	  command queue depth.

	  There is no safe option other than using good SCSI devices.

config SCSI_NCR53C8XX_MAX_TAGS
	int "maximum number of queued commands"
	depends on PCI && SCSI_SYM53C8XX_2!=y && (SCSI_NCR53C8XX || SCSI_SYM53C8XX)
	default "32"
	---help---
	  This option allows you to specify the maximum number of commands
	  that can be queued to any device, when tagged command queuing is
	  possible. The default value is 32. Minimum is 2, maximum is 64.
	  Modern hard disks are able to support 64 tags and even more, but
	  do not seem to be faster when more than 32 tags are being used.

	  So, the normal answer here is to go with the default value 32 unless
	  you are using very large hard disks with large cache (>= 1 MB) that
	  are able to take advantage of more than 32 tagged commands.

	  There is no safe option and the default answer is recommended.

config SCSI_NCR53C8XX_SYNC
	int "synchronous transfers frequency in MHz"
	depends on PCI && SCSI_SYM53C8XX_2!=y && (SCSI_NCR53C8XX || SCSI_SYM53C8XX)
	default "10"
	---help---
	  The SCSI Parallel Interface-2 Standard defines 5 classes of transfer
	  rates: FAST-5, FAST-10, FAST-20, FAST-40 and FAST-80.  The numbers
	  are respectively the maximum data transfer rates in mega-transfers
	  per second for each class.  For example, a FAST-20 Wide 16 device is
	  able to transfer data at 20 million 16 bit packets per second for a
	  total rate of 40 MB/s.

	  You may specify 0 if you want to only use asynchronous data
	  transfers. This is the safest and slowest option. Otherwise, specify
	  a value between 5 and 80, depending on the capability of your SCSI
	  controller.  The higher the number, the faster the data transfer.
	  Note that 80 should normally be ok since the driver decreases the
	  value automatically according to the controller's capabilities.

	  Your answer to this question is ignored for controllers with NVRAM,
	  since the driver will get this information from the user set-up.  It
	  also can be overridden using a boot setup option, as follows
	  (example): 'ncr53c8xx=sync:12' will allow the driver to negotiate
	  for FAST-20 synchronous data transfer (20 mega-transfers per
	  second).

	  The normal answer therefore is not to go with the default but to
	  select the maximum value 80 allowing the driver to use the maximum
	  value supported by each controller. If this causes problems with
	  your SCSI devices, you should come back and decrease the value.

	  There is no safe option other than using good cabling, right
	  terminations and SCSI conformant devices.

config SCSI_NCR53C8XX_PROFILE
	bool "enable profiling"
	depends on PCI && SCSI_SYM53C8XX_2!=y && (SCSI_NCR53C8XX || SCSI_SYM53C8XX)
	help
	  This option allows you to enable profiling information gathering.
	  These statistics are not very accurate due to the low frequency
	  of the kernel clock (100 Hz on i386) and have performance impact
	  on systems that use very fast devices.

	  The normal answer therefore is N.

config SCSI_NCR53C8XX_PQS_PDS
	bool "include support for the NCR PQS/PDS SCSI card"
	depends on (SCSI_NCR53C8XX || SCSI_SYM53C8XX) && SCSI_SYM53C8XX
	help
	  Say Y here if you have a special SCSI adapter produced by NCR
	  corporation called a PCI Quad SCSI or PCI Dual SCSI. You do not need
	  this if you do not have one of these adapters. However, since this
	  device is detected as a specific PCI device, this option is quite
	  safe.

	  The common answer here is N, but answering Y is safe.

config SCSI_NCR53C8XX_NO_DISCONNECT
	bool "not allow targets to disconnect"
	depends on PCI && SCSI_SYM53C8XX_2!=y && (SCSI_NCR53C8XX || SCSI_SYM53C8XX) && SCSI_NCR53C8XX_DEFAULT_TAGS=0
	help
	  This option is only provided for safety if you suspect some SCSI
	  device of yours to not support properly the target-disconnect
	  feature. In that case, you would say Y here. In general however, to
	  not allow targets to disconnect is not reasonable if there is more
	  than 1 device on a SCSI bus. The normal answer therefore is N.

config SCSI_NCR53C8XX_SYMBIOS_COMPAT
	bool "assume boards are SYMBIOS compatible (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on PCI && SCSI_SYM53C8XX_2!=y && (SCSI_NCR53C8XX || SCSI_SYM53C8XX) && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  This option allows you to enable some features depending on GPIO
	  wiring. These General Purpose Input/Output pins can be used for
	  vendor specific features or implementation of the standard SYMBIOS
	  features. Genuine SYMBIOS controllers use GPIO0 in output for
	  controller LED and GPIO3 bit as a flag indicating
	  singled-ended/differential interface. The Tekram DC-390U/F boards
	  uses a different GPIO wiring.

	  Your answer to this question is ignored if all your controllers have
	  NVRAM, since the driver is able to detect the board type from the
	  NVRAM format.

	  If all the controllers in your system are genuine SYMBIOS boards or
	  use BIOS and drivers from SYMBIOS, you would want to say Y here,
	  otherwise N. N is the safe answer.

config UNIX98_PTYS
	bool "Unix98 PTY support"
	---help---
	  A pseudo terminal (PTY) is a software device consisting of two
	  halves: a master and a slave. The slave device behaves identical to
	  a physical terminal; the master device is used by a process to
	  read data from and write data to the slave, thereby emulating a
	  terminal. Typical programs for the master side are telnet servers
	  and xterms.

	  Linux has traditionally used the BSD-like names /dev/ptyxx for
	  masters and /dev/ttyxx for slaves of pseudo terminals. This scheme
	  has a number of problems. The GNU C library glibc 2.1 and later,
	  however, supports the Unix98 naming standard: in order to acquire a
	  pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo
	  terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo
	  terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/<number>. What was
	  traditionally /dev/ttyp2 will then be /dev/pts/2, for example.

	  The entries in /dev/pts/ are created on the fly by a virtual
	  file system; therefore, if you say Y here you should say Y to
	  "/dev/pts file system for Unix98 PTYs" as well.

	  If you want to say Y here, you need to have the C library glibc 2.1
	  or later (equal to libc-6.1, check with "ls -l /lib/libc.so.*").

	  serve several X terminals may want to increase this: every incoming
	  connection and every xterm uses up one PTY.

	  When not in use, each additional set of 256 PTYs occupy
	  approximately 8 KB of kernel memory on 32-bit architectures.
