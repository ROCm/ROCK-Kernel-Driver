config VT
	bool "Virtual terminal"
	requires INPUT=y
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, you will get support for terminal devices with
	  display and keyboard devices. These are called "virtual" because you
	  can run several virtual terminals (also called virtual consoles) on
	  one physical terminal. This is rather useful, for example one
	  virtual terminal can collect system messages and warnings, another
	  one can be used for a text-mode user session, and a third could run
	  an X session, all in parallel. Switching between virtual terminals
	  is done with certain key combinations, usually Alt-<function key>.

	  The setterm command ("man setterm") can be used to change the
	  properties (such as colors or beeping) of a virtual terminal. The
	  man page console_codes(4) ("man console_codes") contains the special
	  character sequences that can be used to change those properties
	  directly. The fonts used on virtual terminals can be changed with
	  the setfont ("man setfont") command and the key bindings are defined
	  with the loadkeys ("man loadkeys") command.

	  You need at least one virtual terminal device in order to make use
	  of your keyboard and monitor. Therefore, only people configuring an
	  embedded system would want to say N here in order to save some
	  memory; the only way to log into such a system is then via a serial
	  or network connection.

	  If unsure, say Y, or else you won't be able to do much with your new
	  shiny Linux system :-)

config VT_CONSOLE
	bool "Support for console on virtual terminal"
	depends on VT
	---help---
	  The system console is the device which receives all kernel messages
	  and warnings and which allows logins in single user mode. If you
	  answer Y here, a virtual terminal (the device used to interact with
	  a physical terminal) can be used as system console. This is the most
	  common mode of operations, so you should say Y here unless you want
	  the kernel messages be output only to a serial port (in which case
	  you should say Y to "Console on serial port", below).

	  If you do say Y here, by default the currently visible virtual
	  terminal (/dev/tty0) will be used as system console. You can change
	  that with a kernel command line option such as "console=tty3" which
	  would use the third virtual terminal as system console. (Try "man
	  bootparam" or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or
	  loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)

	  If unsure, say Y.

config HW_CONSOLE
	bool
	depends on VT && !S390 && !UM
	default y

config SH_SCI
	tristate "Serial (SCI) support"
	help
	  Selecting this option will allow the Linux kernel to transfer data
	  over SCI (Serial Communication Interface) and/or SCIF (Serial
	  Communication Interface with FIFO) which are built into the Hitachi
	  SuperH processor.  The option provides 1 to 3 (depending
	  on the CPU model) standard Linux tty devices, /dev/ttySC[012]; one
	  of these is normally used as the system console.

	  If in doubt, press "y".

config SERIAL_CONSOLE
	bool "Support for console on serial port"
	depends on SERIAL=y || SH_SCI=y
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, it will be possible to use a serial port as the
	  system console (the system console is the device which receives all
	  kernel messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user
	  mode). This could be useful if some terminal or printer is connected
	  to that serial port.

	  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible virtual console
	  (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
	  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
	  "console=ttyS1". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
	  your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the
	  kernel at boot time.)

	  If you don't have a VGA card installed and you say Y here, the
	  kernel will automatically use the first serial line, /dev/ttyS0, as
	  system console.

	  If unsure, say N.

config UNIX98_PTYS
	bool "Unix98 PTY support"
	---help---
	  A pseudo terminal (PTY) is a software device consisting of two
	  halves: a master and a slave. The slave device behaves identical to
	  a physical terminal; the master device is used by a process to
	  read data from and write data to the slave, thereby emulating a
	  terminal. Typical programs for the master side are telnet servers
	  and xterms.

	  Linux has traditionally used the BSD-like names /dev/ptyxx for
	  masters and /dev/ttyxx for slaves of pseudo terminals. This scheme
	  has a number of problems. The GNU C library glibc 2.1 and later,
	  however, supports the Unix98 naming standard: in order to acquire a
	  pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo
	  terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo
	  terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/<number>. What was
	  traditionally /dev/ttyp2 will then be /dev/pts/2, for example.

	  The entries in /dev/pts/ are created on the fly by a virtual
	  file system; therefore, if you say Y here you should say Y to
	  "/dev/pts file system for Unix98 PTYs" as well.

	  If you want to say Y here, you need to have the C library glibc 2.1
	  or later (equal to libc-6.1, check with "ls -l /lib/libc.so.*").
	  Read the instructions in <file:Documentation/Changes> pertaining to
	  pseudo terminals. It's safe to say N.

config UNIX98_PTY_COUNT
	int "Maximum number of Unix98 PTYs in use (0-2048)"
	depends on UNIX98_PTYS
	default "256"
	help
	  The maximum number of Unix98 PTYs that can be used at any one time.
	  The default is 256, and should be enough for desktop systems. Server
	  machines which support incoming telnet/rlogin/ssh connections and/or
	  serve several X terminals may want to increase this: every incoming
	  connection and every xterm uses up one PTY.

	  When not in use, each additional set of 256 PTYs occupy
	  approximately 8 KB of kernel memory on 32-bit architectures.
