	help
	  Select this enable optimizations for model z990.
	  This will be slightly faster but does not work on
	  older machines such as the z900.

config SMP
	bool "Symmetric multi-processing support"
	---help---
	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
	  a system with only one CPU, like most personal computers, say N. If
	  you have a system with more than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
	  singleprocessor machines. On a singleprocessor machine, the kernel
	  will run faster if you say N here.

	  See also the <file:Documentation/smp.txt> and the SMP-HOWTO
	  available at <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Even if you don't know what to do here, say Y.

config NR_CPUS
	int "Maximum number of CPUs (2-64)"
	range 2 64
	depends on SMP
	default "32"
	help
	  This allows you to specify the maximum number of CPUs which this
	  kernel will support.  The maximum supported value is 64 and the
	  minimum value which makes sense is 2.

	  This is purely to save memory - each supported CPU adds
	  approximately sixteen kilobytes to the kernel image.

config MATHEMU
	bool "IEEE FPU emulation"
	depends on MARCH_G5
	help
	  This option is required for IEEE compliant floating point arithmetic
	  on older S/390 machines. Say Y unless you know your machine doesn't 
	  need this.

config S390_SUPPORT
	bool "Kernel support for 31 bit emulation"
	depends on ARCH_S390X
	help
	  Select this option if you want to enable your system kernel to
	  handle system-calls from ELF binaries for 31 bit ESA.  This option
	  (and some other stuff like libraries and such) is needed for
	  executing 31 bit applications.  It is safe to say "Y".

config BINFMT_ELF32
	tristate "Kernel support for 31 bit ELF binaries"
	depends on S390_SUPPORT
	help
	  This allows you to run 32-bit Linux/ELF binaries on your zSeries
	  in 64 bit mode. Everybody wants this; say Y.

comment "I/O subsystem configuration"

config MACHCHK_WARNING
	bool "Process warning machine checks"
	help
	  Select this option if you want the machine check handler on IBM S/390 or
	  zSeries to process warning machine checks (e.g. on power failures). 
	  If unsure, say "Y".

config QDIO
	tristate "QDIO support"
	---help---
	  This driver provides the Queued Direct I/O base support for the
	  IBM S/390 (G5 and G6) and eServer zSeries (z800, z900 and z990).

	  For details please refer to the documentation provided by IBM at
	  <http://www10.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/linux390>

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called qdio.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config QDIO_PERF_STATS
	bool "Performance statistics in /proc"
	depends on QDIO
	help
	  Say Y here to get performance statistics in /proc/qdio_perf

	  If unsure, say N.

comment "Misc"

config PREEMPT
	bool "Preemptible Kernel"
	help
	  This option reduces the latency of the kernel when reacting to
	  real-time or interactive events by allowing a low priority process to
	  be preempted even if it is in kernel mode executing a system call.
	  This allows applications to run more reliably even when the system is
	  under load.

	  Say N if you are unsure.

config IPL
	bool "Builtin IPL record support"
	help
	  If you want to use the produced kernel to IPL directly from a
	  device, you have to merge a bootsector specific to the device
	  into the first bytes of the kernel. You will have to select the
	  IPL device.

choice
	prompt "IPL method generated into head.S"
	depends on IPL
	default IPL_TAPE
	help
	  Select "tape" if you want to IPL the image from a Tape.

	  Select "vm_reader" if you are running under VM/ESA and want
	  to IPL the image from the emulated card reader.

config IPL_TAPE
	bool "tape"

config IPL_VM
	bool "vm_reader"

source "fs/Kconfig.binfmt"

config PROCESS_DEBUG
	bool "Show crashed user process info"
	help
	  Say Y to print all process fault locations to the console.  This is
	  a debugging option; you probably do not want to set it unless you
	  are an S390 port maintainer.

config PFAULT
	bool "Pseudo page fault support"
	help
	  Select this option, if you want to use PFAULT pseudo page fault
	  handling under VM. If running native or in LPAR, this option
	  has no effect. If your VM does not support PFAULT, PAGEEX
	  pseudo page fault handling will be used.
	  Note that VM 4.2 supports PFAULT but has a bug in its
	  implementation that causes some problems.
	  Everybody who wants to run Linux under VM != VM4.2 should select
	  this option.

config SHARED_KERNEL
	bool "VM shared kernel support"
	help
	  Select this option, if you want to share the text segment of the
	  Linux kernel between different VM guests. This reduces memory
	  usage with lots of guests but greatly increases kernel size.
	  You should only select this option if you know what you are
	  doing and want to exploit this feature.

config CMM
	tristate "Cooperative memory management"
	help
	  Select this option, if you want to enable the kernel interface
	  to reduce the memory size of the system. This is accomplished
	  by allocating pages of memory and put them "on hold". This only
	  makes sense for a system running under VM where the unused pages
	  will be reused by VM for other guest systems. The interface
	  allows an external monitor to balance memory of many systems.
	  Everybody who wants to run Linux under VM should select this
	  option.

config CMM_PROC
	bool "/proc interface to cooperative memory management"
	depends on CMM
	help
	  Select this option to enable the /proc interface to the
	  cooperative memory management.

config CMM_IUCV
	bool "IUCV special message interface to cooperative memory management"
	depends on CMM && (SMSGIUCV=y || CMM=SMSGIUCV)
	help
	  Select this option to enable the special message interface to
	  the cooperative memory management.

config VIRT_TIMER
	bool "Virtual CPU timer support"
	help
	  This provides a kernel interface for virtual CPU timers.
	  Default is disabled.

config APPLDATA_BASE
	bool "Linux - VM Monitor Stream, base infrastructure"
	depends on PROC_FS && VIRT_TIMER=y
	help
	  This provides a kernel interface for creating and updating z/VM APPLDATA
	  monitor records. The monitor records are updated at certain time
	  intervals, once the timer is started.
	  Writing 1 or 0 to /proc/appldata/timer starts(1) or stops(0) the timer,
	  i.e. enables or disables monitoring on the Linux side.
	  A custom interval value (in seconds) can be written to
	  /proc/appldata/interval.

	  Defaults are 60 seconds interval and timer off.
	  The /proc entries can also be read from, showing the current settings.

config APPLDATA_MEM
	tristate "Monitor memory management statistics"
	depends on APPLDATA_BASE
	help
	  This provides memory management related data to the Linux - VM Monitor
	  Stream, like paging/swapping rate, memory utilisation, etc.
	  Writing 1 or 0 to /proc/appldata/memory creates(1) or removes(0) a z/VM
	  APPLDATA monitor record, i.e. enables or disables monitoring this record
	  on the z/VM side.

	  Default is disabled.
	  The /proc entry can also be read from, showing the current settings.

	  This can also be compiled as a module, which will be called
	  appldata_mem.o.

config APPLDATA_OS
	tristate "Monitor OS statistics"
	depends on APPLDATA_BASE
	help
	  This provides OS related data to the Linux - VM Monitor Stream, like
	  CPU utilisation, etc.
	  Writing 1 or 0 to /proc/appldata/os creates(1) or removes(0) a z/VM
	  APPLDATA monitor record, i.e. enables or disables monitoring this record
	  on the z/VM side.

	  Default is disabled.
	  This can also be compiled as a module, which will be called
	  appldata_os.o.

config APPLDATA_NET_SUM
	tristate "Monitor overall network statistics"
	depends on APPLDATA_BASE
	help
	  This provides network related data to the Linux - VM Monitor Stream,
	  currently there is only a total sum of network I/O statistics, no
	  per-interface data.
	  Writing 1 or 0 to /proc/appldata/net_sum creates(1) or removes(0) a z/VM
	  APPLDATA monitor record, i.e. enables or disables monitoring this record
	  on the z/VM side.

	  Default is disabled.
	  This can also be compiled as a module, which will be called
	  appldata_net_sum.o.

config NO_IDLE_HZ
	bool "No HZ timer ticks in idle"
	help
	  Switches the regular HZ timer off when the system is going idle.
	  This helps z/VM to detect that the Linux system is idle. VM can
	  then "swap-out" this guest which reduces memory usage. It also
	  reduces the overhead of idle systems.

	  The HZ timer can be switched on/off via /proc/sys/kernel/hz_timer.
	  hz_timer=0 means HZ timer is disabled. hz_timer=1 means HZ
	  timer is active.

config NO_IDLE_HZ_INIT
	bool "HZ timer in idle off by default"
	depends on NO_IDLE_HZ
	help
	  The HZ timer is switched off in idle by default. That means the
	  HZ timer is already disabled at boot time.

	help
	  Say Y here if you are developing drivers or trying to debug and
	  identify kernel problems.

config MAGIC_SYSRQ
	bool "Magic SysRq key"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will have some control over the system even
	  if the system crashes for example during kernel debugging (e.g., you
	  will be able to flush the buffer cache to disk, reboot the system
	  immediately or dump some status information). This is accomplished
	  by pressing various keys while holding SysRq (Alt+PrintScreen). It
	  also works on a serial console (on PC hardware at least), if you
	  send a BREAK and then within 5 seconds a command keypress. The
	  keys are documented in <file:Documentation/sysrq.txt>. Don't say Y
	  unless you really know what this hack does.

config DEBUG_SLAB
	bool "Debug memory allocations"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Say Y here to have the kernel do limited verification on memory
	  allocation as well as poisoning memory on free to catch use of freed
	  memory.

config KALLSYMS
	bool "Load all symbols for debugging/kksymoops"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Say Y here to let the kernel print out symbolic crash information and
	  symbolic stack backtraces. This increases the size of the kernel
	  somewhat, as all symbols have to be loaded into the kernel image.

config DEBUG_INFO
	bool "Compile the kernel with debug info"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
          If you say Y here the resulting kernel image will include
	  debugging info resulting in a larger kernel image.
	  Say Y here only if you plan to use gdb to debug the kernel.
	  If you don't debug the kernel, you can say N.
	  
config DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP
	bool "Sleep-inside-spinlock checking"
	help
