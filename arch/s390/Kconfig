config ARCH_S390X
	bool "64 bit kernel"
	help
	  Select this option if you have a 64 bit IBM zSeries machine
	  and want to use the 64 bit addressing mode.

config SMP
	bool "Symmetric multi-processing support"
	---help---
	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
	  a system with only one CPU, like most personal computers, say N. If
	  you have a system with more than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
	  singleprocessor machines. On a singleprocessor machine, the kernel
	  will run faster if you say N here.

	  See also the <file:Documentation/smp.tex>,
	  <file:Documentation/smp.txt> and the SMP-HOWTO available at
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Even if you don't know what to do here, say Y.

config NR_CPUS
	int "Maximum number of CPUs (2-32)"
	depends on SMP && ARCH_S390X = 'n'
	default "32"
	help
	  This allows you to specify the maximum number of CPUs which this
	  kernel will support.  The maximum supported value is 32 and the
	  minimum value which makes sense is 2.

	  This is purely to save memory - each supported CPU adds
	  approximately eight kilobytes to the kernel image.
	
config NR_CPUS
	int "Maximum number of CPUs (2-64)"
	depends on SMP && ARCH_S390X
	default "64"
	help
	  This allows you to specify the maximum number of CPUs which this
	  kernel will support.  The maximum supported value is 64 and the
	  minimum value which makes sense is 2.

	  This is purely to save memory - each supported CPU adds
	  approximately sixteen kilobytes to the kernel image.

config MATHEMU
	bool "IEEE FPU emulation"
	depends on ARCH_S390X = n
	help
	  This option is required for IEEE compliant floating point arithmetic
	  on older S/390 machines. Say Y unless you know your machine doesn't 
	  need this.

config S390_SUPPORT
	bool "Kernel support for 31 bit emulation"
	depends on ARCH_S390X
	help
	  Select this option if you want to enable your system kernel to
	  handle system-calls from ELF binaries for 31 bit ESA.  This option
	  (and some other stuff like libraries and such) is needed for
	  executing 31 bit applications.  It is safe to say "Y".

	depends on S390_SUPPORT
	default y

config BINFMT_ELF32
	tristate "Kernel support for 31 bit ELF binaries"
	depends on S390_SUPPORT
	help
	  This allows you to run 32-bit Linux/ELF binaries on your zSeries
	  in 64 bit mode. Everybody wants this; say Y.

comment "I/O subsystem configuration"

config MACHCHK_WARNING
	bool "Process warning machine checks"
	help
	  Select this option if you want the machine check handler on IBM S/390 or
	  zSeries to process warning machine checks (e.g. on power failures). 
	  If unsure, say "Y".

config QDIO
	tristate "QDIO support"
	---help---
	  This driver provides the Queued Direct I/O base support for the
	  IBM S/390 (G5 and G6) and eServer zSeries (z800 and z900).

	  For details please refer to the documentation provided by IBM at
	  <http://www10.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/linux390>

	  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called qdio. If you want to compile it as a
	  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config QDIO_PERF_STATS
	bool "Performance statistics in /proc"
	depends on QDIO
	help
	  Say Y here to get performance statistics in /proc/qdio_perf

	  If unsure, say N.

comment "Misc"

config PREEMPT
	bool "Preemptible Kernel"
	help
	  This option reduces the latency of the kernel when reacting to
	  real-time or interactive events by allowing a low priority process to
	  be preempted even if it is in kernel mode executing a system call.
	  This allows applications to run more reliably even when the system is
	  under load.

	  Say N if you are unsure.

config IPL
	bool "Builtin IPL record support"
	help
	  If you want to use the produced kernel to IPL directly from a
	  device, you have to merge a bootsector specific to the device
	  into the first bytes of the kernel. You will have to select the
	  IPL device.

choice
	prompt "IPL method generated into head.S"
	depends on IPL
	default IPL_TAPE
	help
	  Select "tape" if you want to IPL the image from a Tape.

	  Select "vm_reader" if you are running under VM/ESA and want
	  to IPL the image from the emulated card reader.

config IPL_TAPE
	bool "tape"

config IPL_VM
	bool "vm_reader"

endchoice

config KCORE_ELF
	bool
	default y
	---help---
	  If you enabled support for /proc file system then the file
	  /proc/kcore will contain the kernel core image. This can be used
	  in gdb:

	  $ cd /usr/src/linux ; gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore

	  You have two choices here: ELF and A.OUT. Selecting ELF will make
	  /proc/kcore appear in ELF core format as defined by the Executable
	  and Linking Format specification. Selecting A.OUT will choose the
	  old "a.out" format which may be necessary for some old versions
	  of binutils or on some architectures.

	  This is especially useful if you have compiled the kernel with the
	  "-g" option to preserve debugging information. It is mainly used
	  for examining kernel data structures on the live kernel so if you
	  don't understand what this means or are not a kernel hacker, just
	  leave it at its default value ELF.

config BINFMT_ELF
	tristate "Kernel support for ELF binaries"
	---help---
	  ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) is a format for libraries and
	  executables used across different architectures and operating
	  systems. Saying Y here will enable your kernel to run ELF binaries
	  and enlarge it by about 13 KB. ELF support under Linux has now all
	  but replaced the traditional Linux a.out formats (QMAGIC and ZMAGIC)
	  because it is portable (this does *not* mean that you will be able
	  to run executables from different architectures or operating systems
	  however) and makes building run-time libraries very easy. Many new
	  executables are distributed solely in ELF format. You definitely
	  want to say Y here.

	  Information about ELF is contained in the ELF HOWTO available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  If you find that after upgrading from Linux kernel 1.2 and saying Y
	  here, you still can't run any ELF binaries (they just crash), then
	  you'll have to install the newest ELF runtime libraries, including
	  ld.so (check the file <file:Documentation/Changes> for location and
	  latest version).

	  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
	  will be called binfmt_elf. Saying M or N here is dangerous because
	  some crucial programs on your system might be in ELF format.

config BINFMT_MISC
	tristate "Kernel support for MISC binaries"
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, it will be possible to plug wrapper-driven binary
	  formats into the kernel. You will like this especially when you use
	  programs that need an interpreter to run like Java, Python or
	  Emacs-Lisp. It's also useful if you often run DOS executables under
	  the Linux DOS emulator DOSEMU (read the DOSEMU-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>). Once you have
	  registered such a binary class with the kernel, you can start one of
	  those programs simply by typing in its name at a shell prompt; Linux
	  will automatically feed it to the correct interpreter.

	  You can do other nice things, too. Read the file
	  <file:Documentation/binfmt_misc.txt> to learn how to use this
	  feature, and <file:Documentation/java.txt> for information about how
	  to include Java support.

	  You must say Y to "/proc file system support" (CONFIG_PROC_FS) to
	  use this part of the kernel.

	  You may say M here for module support and later load the module when
	  you have use for it; the module is called binfmt_misc. If you
	  don't know what to answer at this point, say Y.

config PROCESS_DEBUG
	bool "Show crashed user process info"
	help
	  Say Y to print all process fault locations to the console.  This is
	  a debugging option; you probably do not want to set it unless you
	  are an S390 port maintainer.

config PFAULT
	bool "Pseudo page fault support"
	help
	  Select this option, if you want to use PFAULT pseudo page fault
	  handling under VM. If running native or in LPAR, this option
	  has no effect. If your VM does not support PFAULT, PAGEEX
	  pseudo page fault handling will be used.
	  Note that VM 4.2 supports PFAULT but has a bug in its
	  implementation that causes some problems.
	  Everybody who wants to run Linux under VM != VM4.2 should select
	  this option.

config SHARED_KERNEL
	bool "VM shared kernel support"
	help
	  Select this option, if you want to share the text segment of the
	  Linux kernel between different VM guests. This reduces memory
	  usage with lots of guests but greatly increases kernel size.
	  You should only select this option if you know what you are
	  doing and want to exploit this feature.

	  identify kernel problems.

config MAGIC_SYSRQ
	bool "Magic SysRq key"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will have some control over the system even
	  if the system crashes for example during kernel debugging (e.g., you
	  will be able to flush the buffer cache to disk, reboot the system
	  immediately or dump some status information). This is accomplished
	  by pressing various keys while holding SysRq (Alt+PrintScreen). It
	  also works on a serial console (on PC hardware at least), if you
	  send a BREAK and then within 5 seconds a command keypress. The
	  keys are documented in <file:Documentation/sysrq.txt>. Don't say Y
	  unless you really know what this hack does.

config DEBUG_SLAB
	bool "Debug memory allocations"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL

	  allocation as well as poisoning memory on free to catch use of freed
	  memory.

config KALLSYMS
	bool "Load all symbols for debugging/kksymoops"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Say Y here to let the kernel print out symbolic crash information and
	  symbolic stack backtraces. This increases the size of the kernel
	  somewhat, as all symbols have to be loaded into the kernel image.

config DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP
	bool "Sleep-inside-spinlock checking"
	help
	  If you say Y here, various routines which may sleep will become very
