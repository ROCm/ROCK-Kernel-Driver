config PARISC
	bool
	default y
	help
	  The PA-RISC microprocessor is designed by Hewlett-Packard and used
	  in many of their workstations & servers (HP9000 700 and 800 series,
	  and later HP3000 series).  The PA-RISC Linux project home page is
	  at <http://www.parisc-linux.org/>.

	prompt "Processor type"
	default PA7000

config PA7000
	bool "PA7000/PA7100"
	---help---
	  This is the processor type of your CPU. This information is used for
	  optimizing purposes.  In order to compile a kernel that can run on
	  all PA CPUs (albeit not optimally fast), you can specify "PA7000"
	  here.

	  Specifying "PA8000" here will allow you to select a 64-bit kernel
	  which is required on some machines.

config PA7100LC
	bool "PA7100LC/PA7300LC"
	help
	  Select this option for a 7100LC or 7300LC processor, as used
	  in the 712, 715/Mirage, A180, B132, C160L and some other machines.

config PA7200
	bool "PA7200"
	help
	  Select this option for the PCX-T' processor, as used in C110, D100
	  and similar machines.

config PA8X00
	bool "PA8000 and up"
	help
	  Select this option for PCX-U to PCX-W2 processors.

	depends on PA7000 || PA7100LC || PA7200
	default y

config PARISC64
	bool "64-bit kernel"
	depends on PA8X00
	help
	  Enable this if you want to support 64bit kernel on PA-RISC platform.
	  
	  At the moment, only people willing to use more than 2GB of RAM,
	  or having a 64bit-only capable PA-RISC machine should say Y here.

	  Since there is no 64bit userland on PA-RISC, there is no point to
	  enable this option otherwise. The 64bit kernel is significantly bigger
	  and slower than the 32bit one.

config 64BIT
	def_bool PARISC64

config PDC_NARROW
	bool "32-bit firmware"
	depends on PARISC64
	help
	  This option will enable owners of C160, C180, C200, C240, C360, J280,
	  J282, J2240 and some D/K/R class to run a 64bit kernel with their
	  32bit PDC firmware.
	
	  Nobody should try this option unless they know what they are doing.
	
	  If unsure, say N.

config SMP
	bool "Symmetric multi-processing support"
	---help---
	  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
	  a system with only one CPU, like most personal computers, say N. If
	  you have a system with more than one CPU, say Y.

	  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
	  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
	  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
	  singleprocessor machines. On a singleprocessor machine, the kernel
	  will run faster if you say N here.

	  See also the <file:Documentation/smp.tex>,
	  <file:Documentation/smp.txt>, <file:Documentation/nmi_watchdog.txt>
	  and the SMP-HOWTO available at
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  If you don't know what to do here, say N.

config PREEMPT
	bool
#	bool "Preemptible Kernel"
	default n

config COMPAT
	bool
	depends on PARISC64
	default y

config HPUX
	bool "Support for HP-UX binaries"
	depends on !PARISC64

config NR_CPUS
	int "Maximum number of CPUs (2-32)"
	depends on SMP
	default "32"

	help
	  Say Y here if you are developing drivers or trying to debug and
	  identify kernel problems.

config DEBUG_SLAB
	bool "Debug memory allocations"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  Say Y here to have the kernel do limited verification on memory
	  allocation as well as poisoning memory on free to catch use of freed
	  memory.

config MAGIC_SYSRQ
	bool "Magic SysRq key"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will have some control over the system even
	  if the system crashes for example during kernel debugging (e.g., you
	  will be able to flush the buffer cache to disk, reboot the system
	  immediately or dump some status information). This is accomplished
	  by pressing various keys while holding SysRq (Alt+PrintScreen). It
	  also works on a serial console (on PC hardware at least), if you
	  send a BREAK and then within 5 seconds a command keypress. The
	  keys are documented in <file:Documentation/sysrq.txt>. Don't say Y
	  unless you really know what this hack does.

config FRAME_POINTER
	bool "Compile the kernel with frame pointers"
	help
	  If you say Y here the resulting kernel image will be slightly larger
	  and slower, but it will give very useful debugging information.
	  If you don't debug the kernel, you can say N, but we may not be able
	  to solve problems without frame pointers.

config DEBUG_INFO
	bool "Compile the kernel with debug info"
	depends on DEBUG_KERNEL
	help
          If you say Y here the resulting kernel image will include
	  debugging info resulting in a larger kernel image.
	  Say Y here only if you plan to use gdb to debug the kernel.
	  If you don't debug the kernel, you can say N.
