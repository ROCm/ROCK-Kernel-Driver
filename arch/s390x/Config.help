CONFIG_SMP
  This enables support for systems with more than one CPU. If you have
  a system with only one CPU, like most personal computers, say N. If
  you have a system with more than one CPU, say Y.

  If you say N here, the kernel will run on single and multiprocessor
  machines, but will use only one CPU of a multiprocessor machine. If
  you say Y here, the kernel will run on many, but not all,
  singleprocessor machines. On a singleprocessor machine, the kernel
  will run faster if you say N here.

  Note that if you say Y here and choose architecture "586" or
  "Pentium" under "Processor family", the kernel will not work on 486
  architectures. Similarly, multiprocessor kernels for the "PPro"
  architecture may not work on all Pentium based boards.

  People using multiprocessor machines who say Y here should also say
  Y to "Enhanced Real Time Clock Support", below. The "Advanced Power
  Management" code will be disabled if you say Y here.

  See also the <file:Documentation/smp.tex>,
  <file:Documentation/smp.txt>, <file:Documentation/i386/IO-APIC.txt>,
  <file:Documentation/nmi_watchdog.txt> and the SMP-HOWTO available at
  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>.

  If you don't know what to do here, say N.

CONFIG_ISA
  Find out whether you have ISA slots on your motherboard.  ISA is the
  name of a bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff
  inside your box.  Other bus systems are PCI, EISA, MicroChannel
  (MCA) or VESA.  ISA is an older system, now being displaced by PCI;
  newer boards don't support it.  If you have ISA, say Y, otherwise N.

CONFIG_MCA
  MicroChannel Architecture is found in some IBM PS/2 machines and
  laptops.  It is a bus system similar to PCI or ISA. See
  <file:Documentation/mca.txt> (and especially the web page given
  there) before attempting to build an MCA bus kernel.

CONFIG_EISA
  The Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) bus was
  developed as an open alternative to the IBM MicroChannel bus.

  The EISA bus provided some of the features of the IBM MicroChannel
  bus while maintaining backward compatibility with cards made for
  the older ISA bus.  The EISA bus saw limited use between 1988 and
  1995 when it was made obsolete by the PCI bus.

  Say Y here if you are building a kernel for an EISA-based machine.

  Otherwise, say N.

CONFIG_KCORE_ELF
  If you enabled support for /proc file system then the file
  /proc/kcore will contain the kernel core image. This can be used
  in gdb:

  $ cd /usr/src/linux ; gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore

  You have two choices here: ELF and A.OUT. Selecting ELF will make
  /proc/kcore appear in ELF core format as defined by the Executable
  and Linking Format specification. Selecting A.OUT will choose the
  old "a.out" format which may be necessary for some old versions
  of binutils or on some architectures.

  This is especially useful if you have compiled the kernel with the
  "-g" option to preserve debugging information. It is mainly used
  for examining kernel data structures on the live kernel so if you
  don't understand what this means or are not a kernel hacker, just
  leave it at its default value ELF.

CONFIG_BINFMT_ELF
  ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) is a format for libraries and
  executables used across different architectures and operating
  systems. Saying Y here will enable your kernel to run ELF binaries
  and enlarge it by about 13 KB. ELF support under Linux has now all
  but replaced the traditional Linux a.out formats (QMAGIC and ZMAGIC)
  because it is portable (this does *not* mean that you will be able
  to run executables from different architectures or operating systems
  however) and makes building run-time libraries very easy. Many new
  executables are distributed solely in ELF format. You definitely
  want to say Y here.

  Information about ELF is contained in the ELF HOWTO available from
  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>.

  If you find that after upgrading from Linux kernel 1.2 and saying Y
  here, you still can't run any ELF binaries (they just crash), then
  you'll have to install the newest ELF runtime libraries, including
  ld.so (check the file <file:Documentation/Changes> for location and
  latest version).

  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
  will be called binfmt_elf.o. Saying M or N here is dangerous because
  some crucial programs on your system might be in ELF format.

CONFIG_BINFMT_MISC
  If you say Y here, it will be possible to plug wrapper-driven binary
  formats into the kernel. You will like this especially when you use
  programs that need an interpreter to run like Java, Python or
  Emacs-Lisp. It's also useful if you often run DOS executables under
  the Linux DOS emulator DOSEMU (read the DOSEMU-HOWTO, available from
  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>). Once you have
  registered such a binary class with the kernel, you can start one of
  those programs simply by typing in its name at a shell prompt; Linux
  will automatically feed it to the correct interpreter.

  You can do other nice things, too. Read the file
  <file:Documentation/binfmt_misc.txt> to learn how to use this
  feature, and <file:Documentation/java.txt> for information about how
  to include Java support.

  You must say Y to "/proc file system support" (CONFIG_PROC_FS) to
  use this part of the kernel.

  You may say M here for module support and later load the module when
  you have use for it; the module is called binfmt_misc.o. If you
  don't know what to answer at this point, say Y.

CONFIG_REMOTE_DEBUG
  If you say Y here, it will be possible to remotely debug the MIPS
  kernel using gdb. This enlarges your kernel image disk size by
  several megabytes and requires a machine with more than 16 MB,
  better 32 MB RAM to avoid excessive linking time. This is only
  useful for kernel hackers. If unsure, say N.

CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ
  If you say Y here, you will have some control over the system even
  if the system crashes for example during kernel debugging (e.g., you
  will be able to flush the buffer cache to disk, reboot the system
  immediately or dump some status information). This is accomplished
  by pressing various keys while holding SysRq (Alt+PrintScreen). It
  also works on a serial console (on PC hardware at least), if you
  send a BREAK and then within 5 seconds a command keypress. The
  keys are documented in <file:Documentation/sysrq.txt>. Don't say Y
  unless you really know what this hack does.

CONFIG_BINFMT_ELF32
  This allows you to run 32-bit Linux/ELF binaries on your Ultra.
  Everybody wants this; say Y.

CONFIG_ARCH_S390
  Select this option, if you want to run the Kernel on one of IBM's
  mainframes of the S/390 generation. You should have installed the
  s390-compiler released by IBM (based on gcc-2.95.1) before.

CONFIG_IPL
  If you want to use the produced kernel to IPL directly from a
  device, you have to merge a bootsector specific to the device
  into the first bytes of the kernel. You will have to select the
  IPL device.

CONFIG_IPL_TAPE
  Select "tape" if you want to IPL the image from a Tape.

  Select "vm_reader" if you are running under VM/ESA and want
  to IPL the image from the emulated card reader.

CONFIG_MACHCHK_WARNING
  Select this option if you want the machine check handler on IBM S/390 or
  zSeries to process warning machine checks (e.g. on power failures). 
  If unsure, say "Y".

CONFIG_S390_SUPPORT
  Select this option if you want to enable your system kernel to
  handle system-calls from ELF binaries for 31 bit ESA.  This option
  (and some other stuff like libraries and such) is needed for
  executing 31 bit applications.  It is safe to say "Y".

CONFIG_PROCESS_DEBUG
  Say Y to print all process fault locations to the console.  This is
  a debugging option; you probably do not want to set it unless you
  are an S390 port maintainer.

CONFIG_PFAULT
  Select this option, if you want to use PFAULT pseudo page fault
  handling under VM. If running native or in LPAR, this option
  has no effect. If your VM does not support PFAULT, PAGEEX
  pseudo page fault handling will be used.
  Note that VM 4.2 supports PFAULT but has a bug in its
  implementation that causes some problems.
  Everybody who wants to run Linux under VM != VM4.2 should select
  this option.

CONFIG_SHARED_KERNEL
  Select this option, if you want to share the text segment of the
  Linux kernel between different VM guests. This reduces memory
  usage with lots of guests but greatly increases kernel size.
  You should only select this option if you know what you are
  doing and want to exploit this feature.

CONFIG_QDIO
  This driver provides the Queued Direct I/O base support for the
  IBM S/390 (G5 and G6) and eServer zSeries (z800 and z900).

  For details please refer to the documentation provided by IBM at
  <http://www10.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/linux390>

  This driver is also available as a module ( = code which can be
  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
  The module will be called qdio.o. If you want to compile it as a
  module, say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.

  If unsure, say Y.

Performance statistics for QDIO base support
CONFIG_QDIO_PERF_STATS
  Say Y here to get performance statistics in /proc/qdio_perf

  If unsure, say N.
