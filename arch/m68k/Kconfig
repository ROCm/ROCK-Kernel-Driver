config EISA
	bool
	---help---
	  The Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA) bus was
	  developed as an open alternative to the IBM MicroChannel bus.

	  The EISA bus provided some of the features of the IBM MicroChannel
	  bus while maintaining backward compatibility with cards made for
	  the older ISA bus.  The EISA bus saw limited use between 1988 and
	  1995 when it was made obsolete by the PCI bus.

	  Say Y here if you are building a kernel for an EISA-based machine.

	  Otherwise, say N.

config MCA
	bool
	help
	  MicroChannel Architecture is found in some IBM PS/2 machines and
	  laptops.  It is a bus system similar to PCI or ISA. See
	  <file:Documentation/mca.txt> (and especially the web page given
	  there) before attempting to build an MCA bus kernel.

config PCMCIA
	tristate
	---help---
	  Say Y here if you want to attach PCMCIA- or PC-cards to your Linux
	  computer.  These are credit-card size devices such as network cards,
	  modems or hard drives often used with laptops computers.  There are
	  actually two varieties of these cards: the older 16 bit PCMCIA cards
	  and the newer 32 bit CardBus cards.  If you want to use CardBus
	  cards, you need to say Y here and also to "CardBus support" below.

	  To use your PC-cards, you will need supporting software from David
	  Hinds' pcmcia-cs package (see the file <file:Documentation/Changes>
	  for location).  Please also read the PCMCIA-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  To compile this driver as modules, choose M here: the
	  modules will be called pcmcia_core and ds.

config AMIGA
	bool "Amiga support"
	help
	  This option enables support for the Amiga series of computers. If
	  you plan to use this kernel on an Amiga, say Y here and browse the
	  material available in <file:Documentation/m68k>; otherwise say N.

config ATARI
	bool "Atari support"
	help
	  This option enables support for the 68000-based Atari series of
	  computers (including the TT, Falcon and Medusa). If you plan to use
	  this kernel on an Atari, say Y here and browse the material
	  available in <file:Documentation/m68k>; otherwise say N.

config HADES
	bool "Hades support"
	depends on ATARI && BROKEN
	help
	  This option enables support for the Hades Atari clone. If you plan
	  to use this kernel on a Hades, say Y here; otherwise say N.

config PCI
	bool
	depends on HADES
	default y
	help
	  Find out whether you have a PCI motherboard. PCI is the name of a
	  bus system, i.e. the way the CPU talks to the other stuff inside
	  your box. Other bus systems are ISA, EISA, MicroChannel (MCA) or
	  VESA. If you have PCI, say Y, otherwise N.

	  The PCI-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>, contains valuable
	  information about which PCI hardware does work under Linux and which
	  doesn't.

config MAC
	bool "Macintosh support"
	help
	  This option enables support for the Apple Macintosh series of
	  computers (yes, there is experimental support now, at least for part
	  of the series).

	  Say N unless you're willing to code the remaining necessary support.

	  Domain workstation such as the DN3500.

config VME
	bool "VME (Motorola and BVM) support"
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to build a kernel for a 680x0 based VME
	  board.  Boards currently supported include Motorola boards MVME147,
	  MVME162, MVME166, MVME167, MVME172, and MVME177.  BVME4000 and
	  BVME6000 boards from BVM Ltd are also supported.

config MVME147
	bool "MVME147 support"
	depends on VME
	help
	  Say Y to include support for early Motorola VME boards.  This will
	  build a kernel which can run on MVME147 single-board computers.  If
	  you select this option you will have to select the appropriate
	  drivers for SCSI, Ethernet and serial ports later on.

config MVME16x
	bool "MVME162, 166 and 167 support"
	depends on VME
	help
	  Say Y to include support for Motorola VME boards.  This will build a
	  kernel which can run on MVME162, MVME166, MVME167, MVME172, and
	  MVME177 boards.  If you select this option you will have to select
	  the appropriate drivers for SCSI, Ethernet and serial ports later
	  on.

config BVME6000
	bool "BVME4000 and BVME6000 support"
	depends on VME
	help
	  Say Y to include support for VME boards from BVM Ltd.  This will
	  build a kernel which can run on BVME4000 and BVME6000 boards.  If
	  you select this option you will have to select the appropriate
	  drivers for SCSI, Ethernet and serial ports later on.

config HP300
	bool "HP9000/300 support"
	help
	  This option enables support for the HP9000/300 series of
	  workstations. Support for these machines is still very experimental.
	  If you plan to try to use the kernel on such a machine say Y here.
	  Everybody else says N.

config DIO
	bool "DIO bus support"
	depends on HP300
	help
	  Say Y here to enable support for the "DIO" expansion bus used in
	  HP300 machines. If you are using such a system you almost certainly
	  want this.

config SUN3X
	bool "Sun3x support"
	help
	  This option enables support for the Sun 3x series of workstations.
	  Be warned that this support is very experimental. You will also want
	  to say Y to 68030 support and N to the other processors below.
	  Note that Sun 3x kernels are not compatible with Sun 3 hardware.
	  General Linux information on the Sun 3x series (now discontinued)
	  is at <http://www.angelfire.com/ca2/tech68k/sun3.html>.

	  If you don't want to compile a kernel for a Sun 3x, say N.

config SUN3
	bool "Sun3 support"
	help
	  This option enables support for the Sun 3 series of workstations
	  (3/50, 3/60, 3/1xx, 3/2xx systems). Enabling this option requires 
	  that all other hardware types must be disabled, as Sun 3 kernels 
	  are incompatible with all other m68k targets (including Sun 3x!).  
	  Also, you will want to say Y to 68020 support and N to the other 
	  processors below.

	  If you don't want to compile a kernel exclusively for a Sun 3, say N.

config Q40
	bool "Q40/Q60 support"
	help
	  The Q40 is a Motorola 68040-based successor to the Sinclair QL
	  manufactured in Germany.  There is an official Q40 home page at
	  <http://www.q40.de/>.  This option enables support for the Q40 and
	  Q60. Select your CPU below.  For 68LC060 don't forget to enable FPU
	  emulation.

comment "Processor type"

config M68020
	bool "68020 support"
	help
	  If you anticipate running this kernel on a computer with a MC68020
	  processor, say Y. Otherwise, say N. Note that the 68020 requires a
	  68851 MMU (Memory Management Unit) to run Linux/m68k, except on the
	  Sun 3, which provides its own version.

config M68030
	bool "68030 support"
	help
	  If you anticipate running this kernel on a computer with a MC68030
	  processor, say Y. Otherwise, say N. Note that a MC68EC030 will not
	  work, as it does not include an MMU (Memory Management Unit).

config M68040
	bool "68040 support"
	help
	  If you anticipate running this kernel on a computer with a MC68LC040
	  or MC68040 processor, say Y. Otherwise, say N. Note that an
	  MC68EC040 will not work, as it does not include an MMU (Memory
	  Management Unit).

config M68060
	bool "68060 support"
	help
	  If you anticipate running this kernel on a computer with a MC68060
	  processor, say Y. Otherwise, say N.

config M68KFPU_EMU
	bool "Math emulation support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  At some point in the future, this will cause floating-point math
	  instructions to be emulated by the kernel on machines that lack a
	  floating-point math coprocessor.  Thrill-seekers and chronically
	  sleep-deprived psychotic hacker types can say Y now, everyone else
	  should probably wait a while.

config M68KFPU_EMU_EXTRAPREC
	bool "Math emulation extra precision"
	depends on M68KFPU_EMU
	help
	  The fpu uses normally a few bit more during calculations for
	  correct rounding, the emulator can (often) do the same but this
	  extra calculation can cost quite some time, so you can disable
	  it here. The emulator will then "only" calculate with a 64 bit
	  mantissa and round slightly incorrect, what is more then enough
	  for normal usage.

config M68KFPU_EMU_ONLY
	bool "Math emulation only kernel"
	depends on M68KFPU_EMU
	help
	  This option prevents any floating-point instructions from being
	  compiled into the kernel, thereby the kernel doesn't save any
	  floating point context anymore during task switches, so this
	  kernel will only be usable on machines without a floating-point
	  math coprocessor. This makes the kernel a bit faster as no tests
	  needs to be executed whether a floating-point instruction in the
	  kernel should be executed or not.

config ADVANCED
	bool "Advanced configuration options"
	---help---
	  This gives you access to some advanced options for the CPU. The
	  defaults should be fine for most users, but these options may make
	  it possible for you to improve performance somewhat if you know what
	  you are doing.

	  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about these options.

	  Most users should say N to this question.

config RMW_INSNS
	bool "Use read-modify-write instructions"
	depends on ADVANCED
	---help---
	  This allows to use certain instructions that work with indivisible
	  read-modify-write bus cycles. While this is faster than the
	  workaround of disabling interrupts, it can conflict with DMA
	  ( = direct memory access) on many Amiga systems, and it is also said
	  to destabilize other machines. It is very likely that this will
	  cause serious problems on any Amiga or Atari Medusa if set. The only
	  configuration where it should work are 68030-based Ataris, where it
	  apparently improves performance. But you've been warned! Unless you
	  really know what you are doing, say N. Try Y only if you're quite
	  adventurous.

config SINGLE_MEMORY_CHUNK
	bool "Use one physical chunk of memory only"
	depends on ADVANCED && !SUN3
	help
	  Ignore all but the first contiguous chunk of physical memory for VM
	  purposes.  This will save a few bytes kernel size and may speed up
	  some operations.  Say N if not sure.

config 060_WRITETHROUGH
	bool "Use write-through caching for 68060 supervisor accesses"
	depends on ADVANCED && M68060
	---help---
	  The 68060 generally uses copyback caching of recently accessed data.
	  Copyback caching means that memory writes will be held in an on-chip
	  cache and only written back to memory some time later.  Saying Y
	  here will force supervisor (kernel) accesses to use writethrough
	  caching.  Writethrough caching means that data is written to memory
	  straight away, so that cache and memory data always agree.
	  Writethrough caching is less efficient, but is needed for some
	  drivers on 68060 based systems where the 68060 bus snooping signal
	  is hardwired on.  The 53c710 SCSI driver is known to suffer from
	  this problem.

config ZORRO
	bool "Amiga Zorro (AutoConfig) bus support"
	depends on AMIGA
	help
	  This enables support for the Zorro bus in the Amiga. If you have
	  expansion cards in your Amiga that conform to the Amiga
	  AutoConfig(tm) specification, say Y, otherwise N. Note that even
	  expansion cards that do not fit in the Zorro slots but fit in e.g.
	  the CPU slot may fall in this category, so you have to say Y to let
	  Linux use these.

config AMIGA_PCMCIA
	bool "Amiga 1200/600 PCMCIA support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on AMIGA && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Include support in the kernel for pcmcia on Amiga 1200 and Amiga
	  600. If you intend to use pcmcia cards say Y; otherwise say N.

config STRAM_SWAP
	bool "Support for ST-RAM as swap space"
	depends on ATARI && BROKEN
	---help---
	  Some Atari 68k macines (including the 520STF and 1020STE) divide
	  their addressible memory into ST and TT sections.  The TT section
	  (up to 512MB) is the main memory; the ST section (up to 4MB) is
	  accessible to the built-in graphics board, runs slower, and is
	  present mainly for backward compatibility with older machines.

	  This enables support for using (parts of) ST-RAM as swap space,
	  instead of as normal system memory. This can first enhance system
	  performance if you have lots of alternate RAM (compared to the size
	  of ST-RAM), because executable code always will reside in faster
	  memory. ST-RAM will remain as ultra-fast swap space. On the other
	  hand, it allows much improved dynamic allocations of ST-RAM buffers
	  for device driver modules (e.g. floppy, ACSI, SLM printer, DMA
	  sound). The probability that such allocations at module load time
	  fail is drastically reduced.

config STRAM_PROC
	bool "ST-RAM statistics in /proc"
	depends on ATARI
	help
	  Say Y here to report ST-RAM usage statistics in /proc/stram.  See
	  the help for CONFIG_STRAM_SWAP for discussion of ST-RAM and its
	  uses.

config HEARTBEAT
	bool "Use power LED as a heartbeat" if AMIGA || APOLLO || ATARI || MAC ||Q40
	default y if !AMIGA && !APOLLO && !ATARI && !MAC && !Q40 && HP300
	help
	  Use the power-on LED on your machine as a load meter.  The exact
	  behavior is platform-dependent, but normally the flash frequency is
	  a hyperbolic function of the 5-minute load average.

# We have a dedicated heartbeat LED. :-)
config PROC_HARDWARE
	bool "/proc/hardware support"
	help
	  Say Y here to support the /proc/hardware file, which gives you
	  access to information about the machine you're running on,
	  including the model, CPU, MMU, clock speed, BogoMIPS rating,
	  and memory size.

config PARPORT
	tristate "Parallel port support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  If you want to use devices connected to your machine's parallel port
	  (the connector at the computer with 25 holes), e.g. printer, ZIP
	  drive, PLIP link (Parallel Line Internet Protocol is mainly used to
	  create a mini network by connecting the parallel ports of two local
	  machines) etc., then you need to say Y here; please read
	  <file:Documentation/parport.txt> and
	  <file:drivers/parport/BUGS-parport>.

	  For extensive information about drivers for many devices attaching
	  to the parallel port see <http://www.torque.net/linux-pp.html> on
	  the WWW.

	  It is possible to share a single parallel port among several devices
	  and it is safe to compile all the corresponding drivers into the
	  kernel. To compile parallel port support as a module, choose M here:
	  the module will be called parport.
	  If you have more than one parallel port and want to specify which
	  port and IRQ to be used by this driver at module load time, take a
	  look at <file:Documentation/parport.txt>.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config PARPORT_AMIGA
	tristate "Amiga builtin port"
	depends on AMIGA && PARPORT
	help
	  Say Y here if you need support for the parallel port hardware on
	  Amiga machines. This code is also available as a module (say M),
	  called parport_amiga. If in doubt, saying N is the safe plan.

config PARPORT_MFC3

	depends on ZORRO && PARPORT
	help
	  Say Y here if you need parallel port support for the MFC3 card.
	  This code is also available as a module (say M), called
	  parport_mfc3. If in doubt, saying N is the safe plan.

config PARPORT_PC
	bool
	depends on Q40 && PARPORT
	default y
	---help---
	  You should say Y here if you have a PC-style parallel port. All IBM
	  PC compatible computers and some Alphas have PC-style parallel
	  ports.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called parport_pc.

	  If unsure, say Y.

config PARPORT_ATARI
	tristate "Atari builtin port"
	depends on ATARI && PARPORT
	help
	  Say Y here if you need support for the parallel port hardware on
	  Atari machines. This code is also available as a module (say M),
	  called parport_atari. If in doubt, saying N is the safe plan.

config PRINTER
	tristate "Parallel printer support"
	depends on PARPORT
	---help---
	  If you intend to attach a printer to the parallel port of your Linux
	  box (as opposed to using a serial printer; if the connector at the
	  printer has 9 or 25 holes ["female"], then it's serial), say Y.
	  Also read the Printing-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  It is possible to share one parallel port among several devices
	  (e.g. printer and ZIP drive) and it is safe to compile the
	  corresponding drivers into the kernel.
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/parport.txt>.  The module will be called lp.

	  If you have several parallel ports, you can specify which ports to
	  use with the "lp" kernel command line option.  (Try "man bootparam"
	  or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about
	  how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)  The syntax of the
	  "lp" command line option can be found in <file:drivers/char/lp.c>.

	  If you have more than 8 printers, you need to increase the LP_NO
	  macro in lp.c and the PARPORT_MAX macro in parport.h.

	  If you have a printer that supports status readback or device ID, or
	  want to use a device that uses enhanced parallel port transfer modes

	---help---
	  This selects whether you want to include the driver for the standard
	  serial ports.  The standard answer is Y.  People who might say N
	  here are those that are setting up dedicated Ethernet WWW/FTP
	  servers, or users that have one of the various bus mice instead of a
	  serial mouse and don't intend to use their machine's standard serial
	  port for anything.  (Note that the Cyclades and Stallion multi
	  serial port drivers do not need this driver built in for them to
	  work.)

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called serial.
	  [WARNING: Do not compile this driver as a module if you are using
	  non-standard serial ports, since the configuration information will
	  be lost when the driver is unloaded.  This limitation may be lifted
	  in the future.]

	  BTW1: If you have a mouseman serial mouse which is not recognized by
	  the X window system, try running gpm first.

	  BTW2: If you intend to use a software modem (also called Winmodem)
	  under Linux, forget it.  These modems are crippled and require
	  proprietary drivers which are only available under Windows.

	  Most people will say Y or M here, so that they can use serial mice,
	  modems and similar devices connecting to the standard serial ports.

config SERIAL_EXTENDED
	bool "Extended dumb serial driver options"
	depends on SERIAL=y
	help
	  If you wish to use any non-standard features of the standard "dumb"
	  driver, say Y here. This includes HUB6 support, shared serial
	  interrupts, special multiport support, support for more than the
	  four COM 1/2/3/4 boards, etc.

	  Note that the answer to this question won't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the questions about serial driver options. If unsure, say N.

config SERIAL_MANY_PORTS
	bool "Support more than 4 serial ports"
	depends on SERIAL_EXTENDED
	help
	  Say Y here if you have dumb serial boards other than the four
	  standard COM 1/2/3/4 ports. This may happen if you have an AST
	  FourPort, Accent Async, Boca (read the Boca mini-HOWTO, available
	  from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>), or other custom
	  serial port hardware which acts similar to standard serial port
	  hardware. If you only use the standard COM 1/2/3/4 ports, you can
	  say N here to save some memory. You can also say Y if you have an
	  "intelligent" multiport card such as Cyclades, Digiboards, etc.

config SERIAL_SHARE_IRQ
	bool "Support for sharing serial interrupts"
	depends on SERIAL_EXTENDED
	help
	  Some serial boards have hardware support which allows multiple dumb

	  support for this in the serial driver, say Y here.

config SERIAL_MULTIPORT

config HUB6

	help
	  Say Y here to enable support in the dumb serial driver to support
	  the HUB6 card.

config VT
	bool "Virtual terminal"
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, you will get support for terminal devices with
	  display and keyboard devices. These are called "virtual" because you
	  can run several virtual terminals (also called virtual consoles) on
	  one physical terminal. This is rather useful, for example one
	  virtual terminal can collect system messages and warnings, another
	  one can be used for a text-mode user session, and a third could run
	  an X session, all in parallel. Switching between virtual terminals
	  is done with certain key combinations, usually Alt-<function key>.

	  The setterm command ("man setterm") can be used to change the
	  properties (such as colors or beeping) of a virtual terminal. The
	  man page console_codes(4) ("man console_codes") contains the special
	  character sequences that can be used to change those properties
	  directly. The fonts used on virtual terminals can be changed with
	  the setfont ("man setfont") command and the key bindings are defined
	  with the loadkeys ("man loadkeys") command.

	  You need at least one virtual terminal device in order to make use
	  of your keyboard and monitor. Therefore, only people configuring an
	  embedded system would want to say N here in order to save some
	  memory; the only way to log into such a system is then via a serial
	  or network connection.

	  If unsure, say Y, or else you won't be able to do much with your new
	  shiny Linux system :-)

config VT_CONSOLE
	bool "Support for console on virtual terminal"
	depends on VT
	---help---
	  The system console is the device which receives all kernel messages
	  and warnings and which allows logins in single user mode. If you
	  answer Y here, a virtual terminal (the device used to interact with
	  a physical terminal) can be used as system console. This is the most
	  common mode of operations, so you should say Y here unless you want
	  the kernel messages be output only to a serial port (in which case
	  you should say Y to "Console on serial port", below).

	  If you do say Y here, by default the currently visible virtual

	---help---
	  If you say Y here and create a character special file /dev/nvram
	  with major number 10 and minor number 144 using mknod ("man mknod"),
	  you get read and write access to the 50 bytes of non-volatile memory
	  in the real time clock (RTC), which is contained in every PC and
	  most Ataris.

	  This memory is conventionally called "CMOS RAM" on PCs and "NVRAM"
	  on Ataris. /dev/nvram may be used to view settings there, or to
	  change them (with some utility). It could also be used to frequently
	  save a few bits of very important data that may not be lost over
	  power-off and for which writing to disk is too insecure. Note
	  however that most NVRAM space in a PC belongs to the BIOS and you
	  should NEVER idly tamper with it. See Ralf Brown's interrupt list
	  for a guide to the use of CMOS bytes by your BIOS.

	  On Atari machines, /dev/nvram is always configured and does not need

	  number 130 using mknod ("man mknod"), you will get a watchdog, i.e.:
	  subsequently opening the file and then failing to write to it for
	  longer than 1 minute will result in rebooting the machine. This
	  could be useful for a networked machine that needs to come back
	  online as fast as possible after a lock-up. There's both a watchdog
	  implementation entirely in software (which can sometimes fail to
	  reboot the machine) and a driver for hardware watchdog boards, which
	  are more robust and can also keep track of the temperature inside
	  your computer. For details, read <file:Documentation/watchdog.txt>
	  in the kernel source.

	  The watchdog is usually used together with the watchdog daemon
	  which is available from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/daemons/watchdog/>. This daemon can
	  also monitor NFS connections and can reboot the machine when the process

config UNIX98_PTYS
	bool "Unix98 PTY support"
	---help---
	  A pseudo terminal (PTY) is a software device consisting of two
	  halves: a master and a slave. The slave device behaves identical to
	  a physical terminal; the master device is used by a process to
	  read data from and write data to the slave, thereby emulating a
	  terminal. Typical programs for the master side are telnet servers
	  and xterms.

	  Linux has traditionally used the BSD-like names /dev/ptyxx for
	  masters and /dev/ttyxx for slaves of pseudo terminals. This scheme
	  has a number of problems. The GNU C library glibc 2.1 and later,
	  however, supports the Unix98 naming standard: in order to acquire a
	  pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo
	  terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo
	  terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/<number>. What was
	  traditionally /dev/ttyp2 will then be /dev/pts/2, for example.

	  The entries in /dev/pts/ are created on the fly by a virtual
	  file system; therefore, if you say Y here you should say Y to
	  "/dev/pts file system for Unix98 PTYs" as well.

	  If you want to say Y here, you need to have the C library glibc 2.1
	  or later (equal to libc-6.1, check with "ls -l /lib/libc.so.*").
	  Read the instructions in <file:Documentation/Changes> pertaining to
	  pseudo terminals. It's safe to say N.

config UNIX98_PTY_COUNT
	int "Maximum number of Unix98 PTYs in use (0-2048)"

	default "256"
	help
	  The maximum number of Unix98 PTYs that can be used at any one time.
	  The default is 256, and should be enough for desktop systems. Server
	  machines which support incoming telnet/rlogin/ssh connections and/or
	  serve several X terminals may want to increase this: every incoming
	  connection and every xterm uses up one PTY.

	  When not in use, each additional set of 256 PTYs occupy
	  approximately 8 KB of kernel memory on 32-bit architectures.
