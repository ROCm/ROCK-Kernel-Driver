	  The EISA bus provided some of the features of the IBM MicroChannel
	  bus while maintaining backward compatibility with cards made for
	  the older ISA bus.  The EISA bus saw limited use between 1988 and
	  1995 when it was made obsolete by the PCI bus.

	  A.out (Assembler.OUTput) is a set of formats for libraries and

	  a.out formats QMAGIC and ZMAGIC until they were replaced with the
	  ELF format.

	  As more and more programs are converted to ELF, the use for a.out
	  will gradually diminish. If you disable this option it will reduce
	  your kernel by one page. This is not much and by itself does not
	  warrant removing support. However its removal is a good idea if you
	  wish to ensure that absolutely none of your programs will use this
	  older executable format. If you don't know what to answer at this
	  point then answer Y. If someone told you "You need a kernel with
	  QMAGIC support" then you'll have to say Y here. You may answer M to
	  compile a.out support as a module and later load the module when you
	  want to use a program or library in a.out format. The module will be

	---help---
	  ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) is a format for libraries and

	  and enlarge it by about 13 KB. ELF support under Linux has now all
	  but replaced the traditional Linux a.out formats (QMAGIC and ZMAGIC)
	  because it is portable (this does *not* mean that you will be able
	  to run executables from different architectures or operating systems
	  however) and makes building run-time libraries very easy. Many new
	  executables are distributed solely in ELF format. You definitely
	  want to say Y here.

	  Information about ELF is contained in the ELF HOWTO available from
	  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  If you find that after upgrading from Linux kernel 1.2 and saying Y

	  you'll have to install the newest ELF runtime libraries, including
	  ld.so (check the file <file:Documentation/Changes> for location and
	  latest version).

	  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),

	---help---
	  If you say Y here, it will be possible to plug wrapper-driven binary
	  formats into the kernel. You will like this especially when you use
	  programs that need an interpreter to run like Java, Python or
	  Emacs-Lisp. It's also useful if you often run DOS executables under
	  the Linux DOS emulator DOSEMU (read the DOSEMU-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>). Once you have
	  registered such a binary class with the kernel, you can start one of
	  those programs simply by typing in its name at a shell prompt; Linux
	  will automatically feed it to the correct interpreter.

	  You can do other nice things, too. Read the file
	  <file:Documentation/binfmt_misc.txt> to learn how to use this
	  feature, and <file:Documentation/java.txt> for information about how
	  to include Java support.

	  You must say Y to "/proc file system support" (CONFIG_PROC_FS) to
	  use this part of the kernel.

	  You may say M here for module support and later load the module when
	  you have use for it; the module is called binfmt_misc. If you
	  don't know what to answer at this point, say Y.

config PM
	bool "Power Management support"
	---help---
	  "Power Management" means that parts of your computer are shut
	  off or put into a power conserving "sleep" mode if they are not
	  being used.  There are two competing standards for doing this: APM
	  and ACPI.  If you want to use either one, say Y here and then also
	  to the requisite support below.

	  Power Management is most important for battery powered laptop
	  computers; if you have a laptop, check out the Linux Laptop home
	  page on the WWW at
	  <http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kharker/linux-laptop/> and the
	  Battery Powered Linux mini-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  Note that, even if you say N here, Linux on the x86 architecture
	  will issue the hlt instruction if nothing is to be done, thereby
	  sending the processor to sleep and saving power.

config PREEMPT
	bool "Preemptible Kernel (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on CPU_32 && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  This option reduces the latency of the kernel when reacting to
	  real-time or interactive events by allowing a low priority process to
	  be preempted even if it is in kernel mode executing a system call.
	  This allows applications to run more reliably even when the system is
	  under load.

	  Say Y here if you are building a kernel for a desktop, embedded
	  or real-time system.  Say N if you are unsure.

config APM
	tristate "Advanced Power Management Emulation"
	depends on PM
	---help---
	  APM is a BIOS specification for saving power using several different
	  techniques. This is mostly useful for battery powered laptops with
	  APM compliant BIOSes. If you say Y here, the system time will be
	  reset after a RESUME operation, the /proc/apm device will provide
	  battery status information, and user-space programs will receive
	  notification of APM "events" (e.g. battery status change).

	  If you select "Y" here, you can disable actual use of the APM
	  BIOS by passing the "apm=off" option to the kernel at boot time.

	  Note that the APM support is almost completely disabled for
	  machines with more than one CPU.

	  In order to use APM, you will need supporting software. For location
	  and more information, read <file:Documentation/pm.txt> and the
	  Battery Powered Linux mini-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.linuxdoc.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  This driver does not spin down disk drives (see the hdparm(8)
	  manpage ("man 8 hdparm") for that), and it doesn't turn off
	  VESA-compliant "green" monitors.

	  This driver does not support the TI 4000M TravelMate and the ACER
	  486/DX4/75 because they don't have compliant BIOSes. Many "green"
	  desktop machines also don't have compliant BIOSes, and this driver
	  may cause those machines to panic during the boot phase.

	  Generally, if you don't have a battery in your machine, there isn't
	  much point in using this driver and you should say N. If you get
	  random kernel OOPSes or reboots that don't seem to be related to
	  anything, try disabling/enabling this option (or disabling/enabling
	  APM in your BIOS).

	  Some other things you should try when experiencing seemingly random,
	  "weird" problems:

	  1) make sure that you have enough swap space and that it is
	  enabled.
	  2) pass the "no-hlt" option to the kernel
	  3) switch on floating point emulation in the kernel and pass
	  the "no387" option to the kernel
	  4) pass the "floppy=nodma" option to the kernel
	  5) pass the "mem=4M" option to the kernel (thereby disabling
	  all but the first 4 MB of RAM)
	  6) make sure that the CPU is not over clocked.
	  7) read the sig11 FAQ at <http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/>
	  8) disable the cache from your BIOS settings
	  9) install a fan for the video card or exchange video RAM
	  10) install a better fan for the CPU
	  11) exchange RAM chips
	  12) exchange the motherboard.

	  To compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be inserted in
	  and removed from the running kernel whenever you want), say M here
	  and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module will be called
	  apm.

config ARTHUR

	depends on CPU_32
	help
	  Say Y here to include the kernel code necessary if you want to run
	  Acorn RISC OS/Arthur binaries under Linux. This code is still very
	  experimental; if this sounds frightening, say N and sleep in peace.
	  You can also say M here to compile this support as a module (which
	  will be called arthur).

config CMDLINE

	default ""
	help
	  On some architectures (EBSA110 and CATS), there is currently no way
	  for the boot loader to pass arguments to the kernel. For these

	  If you say Y here, the LEDs on your machine will be used
	  to provide useful information about your current system status.

	  If you are compiling a kernel for a NetWinder or EBSA-285, you will
	  be able to select which LEDs are active using the options below. If
	  you are compiling a kernel for the EBSA-110 or the LART however, the
	  red LED will simply flash regularly to indicate that the system is

	  If you say Y here, one of the system LEDs (the green one on the
	  NetWinder, the amber one on the EBSA285, or the red one on the LART)
	  will flash regularly to indicate that the system is still
	  operational. This is mainly useful to kernel hackers who are
	  debugging unstable kernels.

	  The LART uses the same LED for both Timer LED and CPU usage LED
	  functions. You may choose to use both, but the Timer LED function
	  will overrule the CPU usage LED.

config LEDS_CPU

	  is not currently executing.

	  The LART uses the same LED for both Timer LED and CPU usage LED
	  functions. You may choose to use both, but the Timer LED function

config ALIGNMENT_TRAP

	help
	  ARM processors can not fetch/store information which is not

	  fetch/store instructions will be emulated in software if you say
	  here, which has a severe performance impact. This is necessary for

config IDE
	tristate "ATA/ATAPI/MFM/RLL support"
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, your kernel will be able to manage low cost mass
	  storage units such as ATA/(E)IDE and ATAPI units. The most common
	  cases are IDE hard drives and ATAPI CD-ROM drives.

	  If your system is pure SCSI and doesn't use these interfaces, you
	  can say N here.

	  Integrated Disk Electronics (IDE aka ATA-1) is a connecting standard
	  for mass storage units such as hard disks. It was designed by
	  Western Digital and Compaq Computer in 1984. It was then named
	  ST506. Quite a number of disks use the IDE interface.

	  AT Attachment (ATA) is the superset of the IDE specifications.
	  ST506 was also called ATA-1.

	  Fast-IDE is ATA-2 (also named Fast ATA), Enhanced IDE (EIDE) is
	  ATA-3. It provides support for larger disks (up to 8.4GB by means of
	  the LBA standard), more disks (4 instead of 2) and for other mass
	  storage units such as tapes and cdrom. UDMA/33 (aka UltraDMA/33) is
	  ATA-4 and provides faster (and more CPU friendly) transfer modes
	  than previous PIO (Programmed processor Input/Output) from previous
	  ATA/IDE standards by means of fast DMA controllers.

	  ATA Packet Interface (ATAPI) is a protocol used by EIDE tape and
	  CD-ROM drives, similar in many respects to the SCSI protocol.

	  SMART IDE (Self Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) was
	  designed in order to prevent data corruption and disk crash by
	  detecting pre hardware failure conditions (heat, access time, and
	  the like...). Disks built since June 1995 may follow this standard.
	  The kernel itself don't manage this; however there are quite a
	  number of user programs such as smart that can query the status of
	  SMART parameters disk.

	  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>. The module
	  will be called ide.

	  For further information, please read <file:Documentation/ide.txt>.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  If you have a PnP sound card and you want to configure it at boot

	help
	  Say Y here to include source-level debugging information in the
	  `vmlinux' binary image. This is handy if you want to use gdb or
	  addr2line to debug the kernel. It has no impact on the in-memory
	  footprint of the running kernel but it can increase the amount of
