	  S3C2410 DMA support. This is needed for drivers like sound which
	  use the S3C2410's DMA system to move data to and from the
	  peripheral blocks.

config S3C2410_DMA_DEBUG
	bool "S3C2410 DMA support debug"
	depends on ARCH_S3C2410 && S3C2410_DMA
	help
	  Enable debugging output for the DMA code. This option sends info
	  to the kernel log, at priority KERN_DEBUG.

	  Note, it is easy to create and fill the log buffer in a small
	  amount of time, as well as using an significant percantage of
	  the CPU time doing so.
