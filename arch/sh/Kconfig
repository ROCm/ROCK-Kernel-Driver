	tristate "Kernel support for ELF binaries"
	---help---
	  ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) is a format for libraries and
	  executables used across different architectures and operating
	  systems. Saying Y here will enable your kernel to run ELF binaries
	  and enlarge it by about 13 KB. ELF support under Linux has now all
	  but replaced the traditional Linux a.out formats (QMAGIC and ZMAGIC)
	  because it is portable (this does *not* mean that you will be able
	  to run executables from different architectures or operating systems
	  however) and makes building run-time libraries very easy. Many new
	  executables are distributed solely in ELF format. You definitely
	  want to say Y here.

	  Information about ELF is contained in the ELF HOWTO available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  If you find that after upgrading from Linux kernel 1.2 and saying Y
	  here, you still can't run any ELF binaries (they just crash), then
	  you'll have to install the newest ELF runtime libraries, including
	  ld.so (check the file <file:Documentation/Changes> for location and
	  latest version).

	  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
	  say M here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.  The module
	  will be called binfmt_elf. Saying M or N here is dangerous because
	  some crucial programs on your system might be in ELF format.

config BINFMT_MISC
	tristate "Kernel support for MISC binaries"

	  If you say Y here, it will be possible to plug wrapper-driven binary
	  formats into the kernel. You will like this especially when you use
	  programs that need an interpreter to run like Java, Python or

	  the Linux DOS emulator DOSEMU (read the DOSEMU-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>). Once you have
	  registered such a binary class with the kernel, you can start one of
	  those programs simply by typing in its name at a shell prompt; Linux
	  will automatically feed it to the correct interpreter.

	  You can do other nice things, too. Read the file
	  <file:Documentation/binfmt_misc.txt> to learn how to use this
	  feature, and <file:Documentation/java.txt> for information about how
	  to include Java support.

	  You must say Y to "/proc file system support" (CONFIG_PROC_FS) to
	  use this part of the kernel.

	  You may say M here for module support and later load the module when
	  you have use for it; the module is called binfmt_misc. If you

	  If you say Y here, your kernel will be able to manage low cost mass
	  storage units such as ATA/(E)IDE and ATAPI units. The most common
	  cases are IDE hard drives and ATAPI CD-ROM drives.

	  If your system is pure SCSI and doesn't use these interfaces, you
	  can say N here.

	  Integrated Disk Electronics (IDE aka ATA-1) is a connecting standard
	  for mass storage units such as hard disks. It was designed by
	  Western Digital and Compaq Computer in 1984. It was then named
	  ST506. Quite a number of disks use the IDE interface.

	  AT Attachment (ATA) is the superset of the IDE specifications.
	  ST506 was also called ATA-1.

	  Fast-IDE is ATA-2 (also named Fast ATA), Enhanced IDE (EIDE) is
	  ATA-3. It provides support for larger disks (up to 8.4GB by means of
	  the LBA standard), more disks (4 instead of 2) and for other mass
	  storage units such as tapes and cdrom. UDMA/33 (aka UltraDMA/33) is
	  ATA-4 and provides faster (and more CPU friendly) transfer modes
	  than previous PIO (Programmed processor Input/Output) from previous
	  ATA/IDE standards by means of fast DMA controllers.

	  ATA Packet Interface (ATAPI) is a protocol used by EIDE tape and
	  CD-ROM drives, similar in many respects to the SCSI protocol.

	  SMART IDE (Self Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology) was
	  designed in order to prevent data corruption and disk crash by
	  detecting pre hardware failure conditions (heat, access time, and
	  the like...). Disks built since June 1995 may follow this standard.
	  The kernel itself don't manage this; however there are quite a
	  number of user programs such as smart that can query the status of
	  SMART parameters disk.

	  If you want to compile this driver as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),

menu "Character devices"

config VT
	bool "Virtual terminal"
	---help---
	  If you say Y here, you will get support for terminal devices with
	  display and keyboard devices. These are called "virtual" because you
	  can run several virtual terminals (also called virtual consoles) on
	  one physical terminal. This is rather useful, for example one
	  virtual terminal can collect system messages and warnings, another
	  one can be used for a text-mode user session, and a third could run
	  an X session, all in parallel. Switching between virtual terminals
	  is done with certain key combinations, usually Alt-<function key>.

	  The setterm command ("man setterm") can be used to change the
	  properties (such as colors or beeping) of a virtual terminal. The
	  man page console_codes(4) ("man console_codes") contains the special
	  character sequences that can be used to change those properties
	  directly. The fonts used on virtual terminals can be changed with
	  the setfont ("man setfont") command and the key bindings are defined
	  with the loadkeys ("man loadkeys") command.

	  You need at least one virtual terminal device in order to make use
	  of your keyboard and monitor. Therefore, only people configuring an
	  embedded system would want to say N here in order to save some
	  memory; the only way to log into such a system is then via a serial
	  or network connection.

	  If unsure, say Y, or else you won't be able to do much with your new

config VT_CONSOLE

	  The system console is the device which receives all kernel messages

	  answer Y here, a virtual terminal (the device used to interact with
	  a physical terminal) can be used as system console. This is the most
	  common mode of operations, so you should say Y here unless you want
	  the kernel messages be output only to a serial port (in which case
	  you should say Y to "Console on serial port", below).

	  If you do say Y here, by default the currently visible virtual
	  terminal (/dev/tty0) will be used as system console. You can change
	  that with a kernel command line option such as "console=tty3" which
	  would use the third virtual terminal as system console. (Try "man

	  here are those that are setting up dedicated Ethernet WWW/FTP
	  servers, or users that have one of the various bus mice instead of a
	  serial mouse and don't intend to use their machine's standard serial

	  in the future.]

	  BTW1: If you have a mouseman serial mouse which is not recognized by
	  the X window system, try running gpm first.

	  BTW2: If you intend to use a software modem (also called Winmodem)
	  under Linux, forget it.  These modems are crippled and require

	  to that serial port.

	  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible virtual console
	  (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
	  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
	  "console=ttyS1". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
	  your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the

comment "Unix 98 PTY support"

config UNIX98_PTYS
	bool "Unix98 PTY support"
	---help---
	  A pseudo terminal (PTY) is a software device consisting of two
	  halves: a master and a slave. The slave device behaves identical to
	  a physical terminal; the master device is used by a process to
	  read data from and write data to the slave, thereby emulating a
	  terminal. Typical programs for the master side are telnet servers
	  and xterms.

	  Linux has traditionally used the BSD-like names /dev/ptyxx for
	  masters and /dev/ttyxx for slaves of pseudo terminals. This scheme
	  has a number of problems. The GNU C library glibc 2.1 and later,
	  however, supports the Unix98 naming standard: in order to acquire a
	  pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo
	  terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo
	  terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/<number>. What was
	  traditionally /dev/ttyp2 will then be /dev/pts/2, for example.

	  The entries in /dev/pts/ are created on the fly by a virtual
	  file system; therefore, if you say Y here you should say Y to
	  "/dev/pts file system for Unix98 PTYs" as well.

	  If you want to say Y here, you need to have the C library glibc 2.1
	  or later (equal to libc-6.1, check with "ls -l /lib/libc.so.*").
	  Read the instructions in <file:Documentation/Changes> pertaining to

	  serve several X terminals may want to increase this: every incoming

	  Also read the Printing-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  It is possible to share one parallel port among several devices
	  (e.g. printer and ZIP drive) and it is safe to compile the
	  corresponding drivers into the kernel.  If you want to compile this

	  read <file:Documentation/modules.txt> and
	  <file:Documentation/parport.txt>.  The module will be called lp.

	  If you have several parallel ports, you can specify which ports to
	  use with the "lp" kernel command line option.  (Try "man bootparam"
	  or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about
	  how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)  The syntax of the
	  "lp" command line option can be found in <file:drivers/char/lp.c>.

	  If you have more than 8 printers, you need to increase the LP_NO

config LP_CONSOLE

	  If you want kernel messages to be printed out as they occur, you
	  can have a console on the printer. This option adds support for
	  doing that; to actually get it to happen you need to pass the
	  option "console=lp0" to the kernel at boot time.

	  If the printer is out of paper (or off, or unplugged, or too
	  busy..) the kernel will stall until the printer is ready again.
	  By defining CONSOLE_LP_STRICT to 0 (at your own risk) you

	  This is the parallel port equivalent of SCSI generic support (sg).
	  It is safe to say N to this -- it is not needed for normal printing

	---help---
	  The PS/2 mouse connects to a special mouse port that looks much like
	  the keyboard port (small circular connector with 6 pins). This way,
	  the mouse does not use any serial ports. This port can also be used
	  for other input devices like light pens, tablets, keypads. Compaq,
	  AST and IBM all use this as their mouse port on currently shipping
	  machines. The trackballs of some laptops are PS/2 mice also. In
	  particular, the C&T 82C710 mouse on TI Travelmates is a PS/2 mouse.

	  Although PS/2 mice are not technically bus mice, they are explained
	  in detail in the Busmouse-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  When using a PS/2 mouse, you can get problems if you want to use the
	  mouse both on the Linux console and under X. Using the "-R" option
	  of the Linux mouse managing program gpm (available from

	  number 130 using mknod ("man mknod"), you will get a watchdog, i.e.:
	  subsequently opening the file and then failing to write to it for
	  longer than 1 minute will result in rebooting the machine. This
	  could be useful for a networked machine that needs to come back
	  online as fast as possible after a lock-up. There's both a watchdog
	  implementation entirely in software (which can sometimes fail to
	  reboot the machine) and a driver for hardware watchdog boards, which
	  are more robust and can also keep track of the temperature inside
	  your computer. For details, read <file:Documentation/watchdog.txt>
	  in the kernel source.

	  The watchdog is usually used together with the watchdog daemon
	  which is available from
