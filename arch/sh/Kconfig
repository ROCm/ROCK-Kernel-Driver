	  display and keyboard devices. These are called "virtual" because you
	  can run several virtual terminals (also called virtual consoles) on
	  one physical terminal. This is rather useful, for example one
	  virtual terminal can collect system messages and warnings, another
	  one can be used for a text-mode user session, and a third could run
	  an X session, all in parallel. Switching between virtual terminals
	  is done with certain key combinations, usually Alt-<function key>.

	  The setterm command ("man setterm") can be used to change the
	  properties (such as colors or beeping) of a virtual terminal. The
	  man page console_codes(4) ("man console_codes") contains the special
	  character sequences that can be used to change those properties
	  directly. The fonts used on virtual terminals can be changed with
	  the setfont ("man setfont") command and the key bindings are defined
	  with the loadkeys ("man loadkeys") command.

	  You need at least one virtual terminal device in order to make use
	  of your keyboard and monitor. Therefore, only people configuring an
	  embedded system would want to say N here in order to save some
	  memory; the only way to log into such a system is then via a serial
	  or network connection.

	  If unsure, say Y, or else you won't be able to do much with your new
	  shiny Linux system :-)

config VT_CONSOLE

	---help---
	  The system console is the device which receives all kernel messages
	  and warnings and which allows logins in single user mode. If you
	  answer Y here, a virtual terminal (the device used to interact with
	  a physical terminal) can be used as system console. This is the most
	  common mode of operations, so you should say Y here unless you want
	  the kernel messages be output only to a serial port (in which case
	  you should say Y to "Console on serial port", below).

	  If you do say Y here, by default the currently visible virtual
	  terminal (/dev/tty0) will be used as system console. You can change
	  that with a kernel command line option such as "console=tty3" which
	  would use the third virtual terminal as system console. (Try "man
	  bootparam" or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or
	  loadlin) about how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)

	---help---
	  This selects whether you want to include the driver for the standard
	  serial ports.  The standard answer is Y.  People who might say N
	  here are those that are setting up dedicated Ethernet WWW/FTP
	  servers, or users that have one of the various bus mice instead of a
	  serial mouse and don't intend to use their machine's standard serial
	  port for anything.  (Note that the Cyclades and Stallion multi
	  serial port drivers do not need this driver built in for them to
	  work.)

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called serial.
	  [WARNING: Do not compile this driver as a module if you are using
	  non-standard serial ports, since the configuration information will
	  be lost when the driver is unloaded.  This limitation may be lifted
	  in the future.]

	  BTW1: If you have a mouseman serial mouse which is not recognized by
	  the X window system, try running gpm first.

	  BTW2: If you intend to use a software modem (also called Winmodem)
	  under Linux, forget it.  These modems are crippled and require
	  proprietary drivers which are only available under Windows.

	  Most people will say Y or M here, so that they can use serial mice,
	  modems and similar devices connecting to the standard serial ports.

config SH_SCI

	help
	  Selecting this option will allow the Linux kernel to transfer data
	  over SCI (Serial Communication Interface) and/or SCIF (Serial
	  Communication Interface with FIFO) which are built into the Hitachi
	  SuperH processor.  The option provides 1 to 3 (depending
	  on the CPU model) standard Linux tty devices, /dev/ttySC[012]; one
	  of these is normally used as the system console.

	  If in doubt, press "y".

config SERIAL_CONSOLE

	  If you say Y here, it will be possible to use a serial port as the
	  system console (the system console is the device which receives all
	  kernel messages and warnings and which allows logins in single user
	  mode). This could be useful if some terminal or printer is connected
	  to that serial port.

	  Even if you say Y here, the currently visible virtual console
	  (/dev/tty0) will still be used as the system console by default, but
	  you can alter that using a kernel command line option such as
	  "console=ttyS1". (Try "man bootparam" or see the documentation of
	  your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about how to pass options to the
	  kernel at boot time.)

	  If you don't have a VGA card installed and you say Y here, the
	  kernel will automatically use the first serial line, /dev/ttyS0, as
	  system console.

	  If unsure, say N.

comment "Unix 98 PTY support"

config UNIX98_PTYS
	bool "Unix98 PTY support"
	---help---
	  A pseudo terminal (PTY) is a software device consisting of two
	  halves: a master and a slave. The slave device behaves identical to
	  a physical terminal; the master device is used by a process to
	  read data from and write data to the slave, thereby emulating a
	  terminal. Typical programs for the master side are telnet servers
	  and xterms.

	  Linux has traditionally used the BSD-like names /dev/ptyxx for
	  masters and /dev/ttyxx for slaves of pseudo terminals. This scheme
	  has a number of problems. The GNU C library glibc 2.1 and later,
	  however, supports the Unix98 naming standard: in order to acquire a
	  pseudo terminal, a process opens /dev/ptmx; the number of the pseudo
	  terminal is then made available to the process and the pseudo
	  terminal slave can be accessed as /dev/pts/<number>. What was
	  traditionally /dev/ttyp2 will then be /dev/pts/2, for example.

	  The entries in /dev/pts/ are created on the fly by a virtual
	  file system; therefore, if you say Y here you should say Y to
	  "/dev/pts file system for Unix98 PTYs" as well.

	  If you want to say Y here, you need to have the C library glibc 2.1
	  or later (equal to libc-6.1, check with "ls -l /lib/libc.so.*").
	  Read the instructions in <file:Documentation/Changes> pertaining to
	  pseudo terminals. It's safe to say N.

config UNIX98_PTY_COUNT
	int "Maximum number of Unix98 PTYs in use (0-2048)"

	default "256"
	help
	  The maximum number of Unix98 PTYs that can be used at any one time.
	  The default is 256, and should be enough for desktop systems. Server
	  machines which support incoming telnet/rlogin/ssh connections and/or
	  serve several X terminals may want to increase this: every incoming
	  connection and every xterm uses up one PTY.

	  When not in use, each additional set of 256 PTYs occupy
	  approximately 8 KB of kernel memory on 32-bit architectures.

config PRINTER

	---help---
	  If you intend to attach a printer to the parallel port of your Linux
	  box (as opposed to using a serial printer; if the connector at the
	  printer has 9 or 25 holes ["female"], then it's serial), say Y.
	  Also read the Printing-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  It is possible to share one parallel port among several devices
	  (e.g. printer and ZIP drive) and it is safe to compile the
	  corresponding drivers into the kernel.
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here and read
	  <file:Documentation/parport.txt>.  The module will be called lp.

	  If you have several parallel ports, you can specify which ports to
	  use with the "lp" kernel command line option.  (Try "man bootparam"
	  or see the documentation of your boot loader (lilo or loadlin) about
	  how to pass options to the kernel at boot time.)  The syntax of the
	  "lp" command line option can be found in <file:drivers/char/lp.c>.

	  If you have more than 8 printers, you need to increase the LP_NO
	  macro in lp.c and the PARPORT_MAX macro in parport.h.

config LP_CONSOLE
	bool "Support for console on line printer"
	depends on PRINTER
	---help---
	  If you want kernel messages to be printed out as they occur, you
	  can have a console on the printer. This option adds support for
	  doing that; to actually get it to happen you need to pass the
	  option "console=lp0" to the kernel at boot time.

	  If the printer is out of paper (or off, or unplugged, or too
	  busy..) the kernel will stall until the printer is ready again.
	  By defining CONSOLE_LP_STRICT to 0 (at your own risk) you
	  can make the kernel continue when this happens,
	  but it'll lose the kernel messages.

	  If unsure, say N.

config PPDEV
	tristate "Support for user-space parallel port device drivers"
	depends on PARPORT
	---help---
	  Saying Y to this adds support for /dev/parport device nodes.  This
	  is needed for programs that want portable access to the parallel
	  port, for instance deviceid (which displays Plug-and-Play device
	  IDs).

	  This is the parallel port equivalent of SCSI generic support (sg).
	  It is safe to say N to this -- it is not needed for normal printing
	  or parallel port CD-ROM/disk support.

	  To compile this support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called ppdev.

	  If unsure, say N.

config PSMOUSE
	bool "PS/2 mouse (aka \"auxiliary device\") support"
	---help---
	  The PS/2 mouse connects to a special mouse port that looks much like
	  the keyboard port (small circular connector with 6 pins). This way,
	  the mouse does not use any serial ports. This port can also be used
	  for other input devices like light pens, tablets, keypads. Compaq,
	  AST and IBM all use this as their mouse port on currently shipping
	  machines. The trackballs of some laptops are PS/2 mice also. In
	  particular, the C&T 82C710 mouse on TI Travelmates is a PS/2 mouse.

	  Although PS/2 mice are not technically bus mice, they are explained
	  in detail in the Busmouse-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  When using a PS/2 mouse, you can get problems if you want to use the
	  mouse both on the Linux console and under X. Using the "-R" option
	  of the Linux mouse managing program gpm (available from
	  <ftp://gnu.systemy.it/pub/gpm/>) solves this problem, or you can get
	  the "mconv2" utility from <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/mouse/>.


menu "Watchdog Cards"

config WATCHDOG
	bool "Watchdog Timer Support"

	  If you say Y here (and to one of the following options) and create a
	  character special file /dev/watchdog with major number 10 and minor
	  number 130 using mknod ("man mknod"), you will get a watchdog, i.e.:
	  subsequently opening the file and then failing to write to it for
	  longer than 1 minute will result in rebooting the machine. This
	  could be useful for a networked machine that needs to come back
	  online as fast as possible after a lock-up. There's both a watchdog
	  implementation entirely in software (which can sometimes fail to
	  reboot the machine) and a driver for hardware watchdog boards, which
	  are more robust and can also keep track of the temperature inside
	  your computer. For details, read <file:Documentation/watchdog.txt>
	  in the kernel source.

	  The watchdog is usually used together with the watchdog daemon
	  which is available from
	  <ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/system/daemons/watchdog/>. This daemon can
	  also monitor NFS connections and can reboot the machine when the process
	  table is full.

	  If unsure, say N.

config WATCHDOG_NOWAYOUT
	bool "Disable watchdog shutdown on close"
	depends on WATCHDOG
	help
	  The default watchdog behaviour (which you get if you say N here) is
	  to stop the timer if the process managing it closes the file
	  /dev/watchdog. It's always remotely possible that this process might
	  get killed. If you say Y here, the watchdog cannot be stopped once
	  it has been started.

config SH_WDT
	tristate "SuperH Watchdog"
	depends on WATCHDOG
	help
	  This driver adds watchdog support for the integrated watchdog in the
	  SuperH processors. If you have one of these processors and wish
	  to have watchdog support enabled, say Y, otherwise say N.

	  As a side note, saying Y here will automatically boost HZ to 1000
	  so that the timer has a chance to clear the overflow counter. On
	  slower systems (such as the SH-2 and SH-3) this will likely yield
	  some performance issues. As such, the WDT should be avoided here
	  unless it is absolutely necessary.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the

config RTC

	---help---
	  If you say Y here and create a character special file /dev/rtc with

	  will get access to the real time clock (or hardware clock) built
	  into your computer.

	  Every PC has such a clock built in. It can be used to generate
	  signals from as low as 1Hz up to 8192Hz, and can also be used
	  as a 24 hour alarm. It reports status information via the file
	  /proc/driver/rtc and its behaviour is set by various ioctls on
	  /dev/rtc.

	  If you run Linux on a multiprocessor machine and said Y to
	  "Symmetric Multi Processing" above, you should say Y here to read
	  and set the RTC in an SMP compatible fashion.
