config CPU_FREQ
	bool "CPU Frequency scaling"
	help
	  Clock scaling allows you to change the clock speed of CPUs on the
	  fly. This is a nice method to save battery power on notebooks,
	  because the lower the clock speed, the less power the CPU consumes.

	  For more information, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>
	  or at <http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/cpufreq/>

	  If in doubt, say N.

config CPU_FREQ_TABLE
       tristate "CPU frequency table helpers"
       depends on CPU_FREQ
       default y
       help
         Many CPUFreq drivers use these helpers, so only say N here if
	 the CPUFreq driver of your choice doesn't need these helpers.

	 If in doubt, say Y.

config X86_ACPI_CPUFREQ
	tristate "ACPI Processor P-States driver"
	depends on CPU_FREQ_TABLE && ACPI_PROCESSOR
	help
	  This driver adds a CPUFreq driver which utilizes the ACPI
	  Processor Performance States.

	help
	  This enables the deprecated /proc/acpi/processor/../performance 
	  interface. While it is helpful for debugging, the generic,
	  cross-architecture cpufreq interfaces should be used.

	  If in doubt, say N.

	  processors.

	  You need to specify the processor maximum speed as boot
	  parameter: elanfreq=maxspeed (in kHz) or as module
	  parameter "max_freq".
