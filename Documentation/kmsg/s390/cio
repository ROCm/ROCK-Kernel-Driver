 * excluded from being sensed and analyzed.
 * User action:
 * Correct your device specification in the kernel parameter line to have the
 * device excluded when you next reboot Linux. You can write the correct
 * device specification to /proc/cio_ignore to add the device to the list of
 * devices to be excluded. This does not immediately make the device
