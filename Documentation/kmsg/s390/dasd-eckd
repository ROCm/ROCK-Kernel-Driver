 * Text: "%s: Detecting the DASD disk layout failed because of an I/O error\n"
 * Severity: Error
 * Parameter:
 *   @1: bus ID of the DASD
 * Description:
 * The disk layout of the DASD could not be detected because of an unexpected
 * I/O error. The DASD device driver treats the device like an unformatted DASD,
 * and partitions on the device are not accessible.
 * User action:
 * If the DASD is formatted, make sure that the DASD is working correctly,
 * then set it offline and back online. If the DASD is unformatted, format the
 * DASD, for example, with dasdfmt.
 * ATTENTION: Formatting irreversibly destroys all data on the DASD.
