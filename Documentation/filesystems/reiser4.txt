Reiser4 filesystem
==================
Reiser4 is a file system based on dancing tree algorithms, and is
described at http://www.namesys.com

Compile options
===============
Use larger keys on reiser4 tree
	Make keys larger and use additional bits to order bodies of
	files within a directory in the order of their names, which is
	what you want normally. If you turn this off, file bodies will
	be ordered by creation time, which is not optimal for most
	users.

	Turn this off to mount filesystems created with non-default key plugin:
	mkfs.reiser4 -o key=key_short /dev/hdb6
	You can find which key plugin your filesystem is created with:
	debugfs.reiser4 /dev/hdb6 | grep "key policy"
	If it says:
	key policy:	SHORT
	then you need to turn this option OFF
	If it says
	key policy:	LARGE
	then you have to turn this ON
	Note, that currently you can mount either only filesystems
	with large keys or only filesystems with small keys.

Enable reiser4 debug options
       It makes available a lot of various options. They are supposed
       to be used for debugging/profiling purposes. Make menuconfig
       provides their thorough documentation.


Mount options
=============
tmgr.atom_max_size=N
	Atoms containing more than N blocks will be forced to commit.
	N is decimal.
	Default is nr_free_pagecache_pages() / 2 at mount time.

tmgr.atom_max_age=N
	Atoms older than N seconds will be forced to commit. N is decimal.
	Default is 600.

tmgr.atom_max_flushers=N
	Limit of concurrent flushers for one atom. 0 means no limit.
	Default is 0.

tree.cbk_cache.nr_slots=N
	Number of slots in the cbk cache.

flush.relocate_threshold=N
	If flush finds more than N adjacent dirty leaf-level blocks it
	will force them to be relocated.
	Default is 64.

flush.relocate_distance=N
	If flush finds can find a block allocation closer than at most
	N from the preceder it will relocate to that position.
	Default is 64.

flush.scan_maxnodes=N
	The maximum number of nodes to scan left on a level during
	flush.
	Default is 10000.

optimal_io_size=N
	Preferred IO size. This value is used to set st_blksize of
	struct stat.
	Default is 65536.

bsdgroups
	Turn on BSD-style gid assignment.

32bittimes
	By default file in reiser4 have 64 bit timestamps. Files
	created when filesystem is mounted with 32bittimes mount
	option will get 32 bit timestamps.

mtflush
	Turn off concurrent flushing.

nopseudo
	Disable pseudo files support. See
	http://namesys.com/v4/pseudo.html for more about pseudo files.

dont_load_bitmap
	Don't load all bitmap blocks at mount time, it is useful for
	machines with tiny RAM and large disks.
