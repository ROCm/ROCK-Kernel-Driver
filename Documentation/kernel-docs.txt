   The need for a document like this one became apparent in the
   linux-kernel mailing list as the same questions, asking for pointers
   to information, appeared again and again.
   
   Fortunately, as more and more people get to GNU/Linux, more and more
   get interested in the Kernel. But reading the sources is not always
   enough. It is easy to understand the code, but miss the concepts, the
   philosophy and design decisions behind this code.
   
   Unfortunately, not many documents are available for beginners to
   start. And, even if they exist, there was no "well-known" place which
   kept track of them. These lines try to cover this lack. All documents
   available on line known by the author are listed, while some reference
   books are also mentioned.
   
   PLEASE, if you know any paper not listed here or write a new document,
   send me an e-mail, and I'll include a reference to it here. Any
   corrections, ideas or comments are also welcomed.
   
   The papers that follow are listed in no particular order. All are
   cataloged with the following fields: the document's "Title", the
   "Author"/s, the "URL" where they can be found, some "Keywords" helpful
   when searching for specific topics, and a brief "Description" of the
   Document.
   
   Enjoy!

       how your Operating System allows you to manage a large number of
       open files (file descriptors in UNIX/POSIX, or FDs) in your
       application. You want the OS to notify you when FDs become active
       (have data ready to be read or are ready for writing). Ideally you
       want a mechanism that is scalable. This means a large number of
       inactive FDs cost very little in memory and CPU time to manage".

       Description: From the Introduction: "Please understand that I
       never wanted to write this document, being grossly underqualified,
       but I always wanted to read it, and this was the only way. I
       simply explain some best practices, and give reading entry-points
       into the kernel sources. I avoid implementation details: that's
       what the code is for, and I ignore whole tracts of useful
       routines. This document assumes familiarity with C, and an
       understanding of what the kernel is, and how it is used. It was
       originally written for the 2.3 kernels, but nearly all of it
       applies to 2.2 too; 2.0 is slightly different. ".

       Author: Detlef Fliegl.
       URL: http://usb.in.tum.de/usbdoc/
       Keywords: USB, universal serial bus.
       Description: A must-read. From the Preface: "This document should
       give detailed information about the current state of the USB
       subsystem and its API for USB device drivers. The first section
       will deal with the basics of USB devices. You will learn about
       different types of devices and their properties. Going into detail
       you will see how USB devices communicate on the bus. The second
       section gives an overview of the Linux USB subsystem [2] and the
       device driver framework. Then the API and its data structures will
       be explained step by step. The last section of this document
       contains a reference of all API calls and their return codes".
