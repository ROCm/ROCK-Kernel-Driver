Internal modem country code setting for icom serial device driver adapters.

If the icom serial device driver adapter you are using contains an internal
modem you may need to configure your modem for your country.  You can use
the proc file data provided by the icom driver to determine whether an
internal modem is present.  Simply "cat /proc/tty/driver/icom" and analyze
its output.  If the cable field in the icom proc file output indicates an
"InternalModem" type (1) then that port contains an internal modem and may
need to have its country code set.  Using a serial console, you will need
to issue an AT commands to determine the current country code setting.  The
major and minor number of the port containing the internal modem can also
be obtained from icom proc file data.  Using this information you can
determine which tty device to open with your serial console.  Once the
serial console is opened against the proper device, issue the command
"ATI9" to the modem.  The first set of digits returned are the encoded
country code setting for the modem (in decimal), eg.

>ATI9
>52
>
>(.$MTS0314\\MODEM\TIA0602,TIA0578\MultiTech Systems MT5656SMI-L38)
>
>OK

In this example, the country code setting of the modem is set to "52".  By
referencing the table below you can determine if the current country code
is set correctly.  If you find that the country code is not set correctly,
you will need to issue another command to the modem to set the country
code.  The command to set a new country code is "AT%T19,0,x", where x is
the new country code (in hex), eg. to set a new country code for Japan,
issue the command "AT%T19,0,10".  Use "ATI9" to verify the country code was
set correctly.

(1) The older serial adapters supported by this device driver do not
indicate when an Internal modem is present.  If the serial adapter
installed in your system is a model 2771 then Port 0 is the internal modem
which may require country code configuration.  If the serial adapter
installed in your system is a model 2772 (0609/0610), then both Port 0 and
Port 1 are internal modems which may require country code configuration.
