/* Parser for the reiser4() system call */

If you want to read about where future versions of this syntax will
go, and what the grand scheme is, please go to
www.namesys.com/future_vision.html.

Names resolve into sets of keys.  In Reiser4, the sets of keys all
consist of exactly one key, but this will change in future versions.

Keys are not immutable objectids ala inode numbers.  The use of
immutable objectids that all objects could be found by was the
original architecture, and before coding was started this was realized
to require lower performance due to creating immutable, and therefor
poor, locality of reference when resolving them.  Keys currently do
contain unique objectids, but this objectid does not suffice for
finding the object.

Name compounders construct names from subnames.  / and [] ([] is not
implemented in reiser4, see www.namesys.com/future_vision.html for
what it will do in a later version) are name compounders.  Name
compounders can use any name which can be resolved into a key as a
subname.  This provides "closure", in which the type of the result of
every name operation is the same as the type of what the name
operators operate on.  (Persons who create abstract models tend to
place a high value on achieving closure in their design.  For more
about closure, read www.namesys.com/future_vision.html.)

A/B indicates that B is to be passed to A, and A will resolve its
meaning.  This is consistent with Unix usage of /.  B is considered
a subname of A in this example.

Reiser4 supports a plugin that implements Unix regular files (regfile),
and a plugin that implements Unix regular directories (regdir). (NIKITA-FIXME-HANS: use those names in the code)

Plugins may resolve a subname by invoking a plugin of another object,
or by invoking methods built into themselves.

Special characters are whitespace plus []{}()/\,:;*$@!`' and keywords
are <- and ->

<-, ->,  are assignment operators.


'A<-B' uses B's read method to read B, and uses A'S write method to
write to A what was read from B.  It is a copy command similar to
sendfile().

The righthand side of an assignment defines a flow.  We calculate the flow,
and then invoke the the write method defined by the lefthand side of
the assignment.

Example:

A<-B

assigns the contents of the object named B to A, overwriting the contents of A if A exists.

` and ' indicate that all special characters between them should be
ignored and parsed as a single string. That is, A<-`some text' causes A to have
contents equal to a file named `some text'.  Quotes are allowed to nest.

" indicates that the next word is inlined text.  Sorry, " is the symbol least useful for something else, so it got used.

A<-"(this is a string not a name of a file)  // German style quoting: ,,ksdajfhkasdh``

assigns (sans the single quotes) the string `this is a string not a name of a file' to A.

A<-"`I think that using " in a language for delimiting quoting is bad style because delimiters should be matching pairs not matching identical singletons if nesting is to work at all.'

assigns the string `I think that using " in a language for delimiting quoting is bad style because delimiters should be matching pairs not matching identical singletons if nesting is to work at all.' to A

A<<-B

appends file B to file A

We need to define multiple aspects of the object when creating it.
Additionally, we need to assign default values to those aspects of the
definition not defined.  The problem arises when we have a multi-part
definition.  We should avoid assigning one part, then assigning
default values for all other parts, then overwriting those default
values, some of which actually cannot be overwritten (e.g. pluginid).

This means we need to name the object, and then perform multiple
assignments in its creation.

(x_ and )x_ where x is any sequence (including the null sequence) of
non-special characters, are `named parenthesis'.  They have the usual meaning of
parenthesis in most languages, and delimit what should be treated as a
single unit by operators.  If you use named parenthesis you can avoid
the "LISP bird nest" effect.  The disadvantage is that if you leave
off the whitespace following the open parenthesis you will get an
unintended effect.  Note that there must be no space between ( and x.

Referencing the contents of parenthesis by the name of the parenthesis
is planned in later versions..

It is an unenforced but encouraged style convention that subnames which contain
meta-information about the object, and pseudo-files that implement
methods of the object, begin with `..'.  IT IS NOT A REQUIREMENT
THAT THEY START WITH `..',  READ THAT AGAIN!  Sorry, got tired of the complaints about
the non-existent requirement.  It all depends on how you write your plugins that
use the meta-information whether the meta-data starts with `..'.

Since what is meta-information, what is a method of the object, and
what is contained information, or methods of sub-objects, are not
necessarily always inherently susceptible to precise natural
distinction, and since we desire to allow users maximal stylistic
freedom to extend reiser4 into emulating other syntaxes, this is only
an optional plugin design convention for use when appropriate.

One can specify whether a file is listed by readdir in reiser4.  Using
that feature, subnames of files containing meta-information about
other files are by convention not listed by readdir, but can be listed
by using the command reiser4("A_listing<-A/..list"), and then reading
the file A_listing.

For instance, if A is a regfile or regdir, then A/..owner resolves to
a file containing the owner of A, and reading the A directory shows no
file named ..owner.  More generally, all of the fields returned by
stat() have a corresponding name of the form A/..field_name for all
regfiles and regdirs.  The use of'..' avoids clashes between method
names and filenames.  More extreme measures could be taken using
something more obscure than '..' as a prefix, but I remember that
Clearcase and WAFL never really had much in the way of problems with
namespace collisions affecting users seriously, so I don't think one
should excessively inconvenience a syntax for such reasons.

DEMIDOV-FIXME-HANS: the paragraph below conflicts with the above
*A (similar to C language dereference) means take the contents of
that object which A is the name for, and treat those contents as a name.


*`A B' is a reference to a file whose name consists of the characters
A and a space and a B.


A;B indicates that B is not to be executed until A completes.  So, `/'
orders subnames within a compound name, and `;' orders operations.


A,B indicates that A and B are independent of each other and
unordered.

A/B indicates that the plugin for A is to be passed B,
and asked to handle it in its way, whatever that way is.

/ and \ are considered equivalent, as a kindness to former windows users

C/..invert<-A +"(some text)+ B

indicates that C when read shall return the contents of A followed by
'some text' as a delimiter followed by the contents of B.

if  A  and   B  are object expressions then
               A+B  is object expression
               A\B  is object expression
               A<-B is possible operation


So, let us discuss the following example:

Assume 357 is the user id of Michael Jackson.

The following 3 expressions are equivalent:

ascii_command = "/home/teletubbies/(..new(..name<-glove_location, ..object_t<-audit/regular, ..perm_t<-acl); glove_location/..acl<-( uid<-357, access<-denied ); glove_location/..audit<-mailto<-teletubbies@pbs.org; glove_location<-'we stole it quite some number of years ago, and put it in the very first loot pile (in the hole near the purple flower.')";

ascii_command = "/home/teletubbies/(glove_location<-( ..object_t<-audit/regular, ..perm_t<-acl); glove_location/..acl<-  ( uid<-357, access<-denied ); glove_location/..audit<-mailto<-teletubbies@pbs.org; glove_location<-'we stole it quite some number of years ago, and put it in the very first loot pile (in the hole near the purple flower)')";


ascii_command = "/home/teletubbies/(glove_location<-( ..object_t<-audit/regular, ..perm_t<-acl); glove_location / ( ..acl<-(uid<-357, access<-denied) ; ..audit<-mailto<-teletubbies@pbs.org); glove_location<-'we stole it quite some number of years ago, and put it in the very first loot pile (in the hole near the purple flower).')";

DEMIDOV-FIXME-HANS: what is the meaning of the line below, and should it be ..new rather than new
a/b/(new/(name<-"new_file_name"; type<-"regular file"; perm_t<-"acl"); new_file_name/acl<- ( uid<-"357", access<-"denied" ))

DEMIDOV-FIXME-HANS: what is the meaning of ..anon and backing?
ascii_command =
   "/home/teletubbies/glove_location<-
             ( (..object_t<-audit, ..perm_t<-acl) ;
                ..acl<-  ( uid<-'357', access<-denied );
                ..audit/(backing<-..anon<=(..object_t<-regular); // lookup<-/home/teletubbies/some-existing-file),
                         log<-(mailto<-teletubbies@pbs.org));
                ..body<-'we stole it quite some number of years ago, and put it in the very first loot pile (in the hole near the purple flower)';)";

(a b)
result<-/subject/[elves strike]
(result /subject/[elves strike])
/subject/[elves strike]->result




DEMIDOV-FIXME-HANS: cleanup the explanation below
The components of this example have the following meanings:
/home/teletubbies/       - directory name
/(..name                 - specifies that its argument is the name of the new file - parameter for ..new plugin
/glove_location, - name of new file - parameter for name submethod of ..new method

/audit         - plugin for file
/regular,      - plugin for backing store for audit plugin
..perm_t       - security plugin to be assigned
)              - end of parameters for ..new plugin
;              - next system call
glove_location - file name
/..acl         - plugin ..acl
(              - begin parameters for ..new plugin of ..acl plugin
uid            - plugin of ..acl plugin
/357           - its value(parameter)
,              -
access         - ..
/denied        -  value to assign
)              - end of parameter list
)              - ? unbalanced brakes
;
..audit        - plugin - file is unknown!
/..new
/mailto
/"teletubbies@pbs.org"
;
glove_location_file - file name
/

"we stole it quite some number of years ago, and put it in the very first loot pile (in the hole near the purple flower)." - body of file

Assignment, and transaction, will be the commands supported in Reiser4(); more commands will appear in Reiser5. -> and <- will be the assignment operators.

The amount transferred by an assignment is the minimum of the size of the left hand side and the size of the right hand side.  This amount is usually made one of the return values.

    * lhs (assignment target) values:

    /..process/..range/(first_byte<-(loff_t),last_byte<-(loff_t),bytes_written<-(ssize_t*) )
              assigns (writes) to the buffer starting at address first_byte in the process address space, ending at last_byte, with the number of bytes actually written
	      (The assignment source may be smaller or larger than the assignment target.) being written to address bytes_written.
	      Representation of first_byte,last_byte, and bytes_written is left to the coder to determine.
	      It is an issue that will be of much dispute and little importance.
	      Notice / is used to indicate that the order of the operands matters; see www.namesys.com/future_vision.html for details of why this is appropriate syntax design.
	      Note the lack of a file descriptor.

    /filename
              assigns to the file named filename, wholly obliterating its body with what is assigned.

    /filename/..range/(first_byte<-(loff_t),last_byte<-(loff_t),bytes_written<-(ssize_t*) )
              writes to the body, starting at first_byte, ending not past last_byte,
	      recording number of bytes written in bytes_written

    /filename/..range/(first_byte<-(loff_t),bytes_written<-(ssize_t*) )
              writes to the body starting at offset, recording number of bytes written in bytes_written

    * rhs (assignment source) values:

    /..process/..range/(first_byte<-(loff_t),last_byte<-(loff_t),bytes_read<-(ssize_t*) )
              reads from the buffer starting at address first_byte in the process address space, ending at last_byte.
	      The number of bytes actually read (assignment source may be smaller or larger than assignment target) is written to address bytes_read.
	      Representation of first_byte, last_byte, and bytes_read is left to the coder to determine, as it is an issue that will be of much dispute and little importance.

    /filename
              reads the entirety of the file named filename.

    /filename/..range/(first_byte<-(loff_t),last_byte<-(loff_t),bytes_read<-(ssize_t*) )
              reads from the body, starting at first_byte, ending not past last_byte,
              recording number of bytes read in bytes_read

    /filename/..range/(first_byte<-(loff_t),bytes_read<-(ssize_t*) )
              reads from the body starting at offset until the end, recording number of bytes read in bytes_read

    /filename/..stat/owner
              reads from the ownership field of the stat data (stat data is that which is returned by the
              stat() system call (owner, permissions, etc.) and stored on a per file basis by the FS.)
