/* Seals implementation. */
/* Seals are "weak" tree pointers. They are analogous to tree coords in
   allowing to bypass tree traversal. But normal usage of coords implies that
   node pointed to by coord is locked, whereas seals don't keep a lock (or
   even a reference) to znode. In stead, each znode contains a version number,
   increased on each znode modification. This version number is copied into a
   seal when seal is created. Later, one can "validate" seal by calling
   seal_validate(). If znode is in cache and its version number is still the
   same, seal is "pristine" and coord associated with it can be re-used
   immediately.

   If, on the other hand, znode is out of cache, or it is obviously different
   one from the znode seal was initially attached to (for example, it is on
   the different level, or is being removed from the tree), seal is
   irreparably invalid ("burned") and tree traversal has to be repeated.

   Otherwise, there is some hope, that while znode was modified (and seal was
   "broken" as a result), key attached to the seal is still in the node. This
   is checked by first comparing this key with delimiting keys of node and, if
   key is ok, doing intra-node lookup.

   Znode version is maintained in the following way:

   there is reiser4_tree.znode_epoch counter. Whenever new znode is created,
   znode_epoch is incremented and its new value is stored in ->version field
   of new znode. Whenever znode is dirtied (which means it was probably
   modified), znode_epoch is also incremented and its new value is stored in
   znode->version. This is done so, because just incrementing znode->version
   on each update is not enough: it may so happen, that znode get deleted, new
   znode is allocated for the same disk block and gets the same version
   counter, tricking seal code into false positive.
