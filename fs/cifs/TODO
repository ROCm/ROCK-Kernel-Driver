A Partial List of Known Problems and Missing Features
=====================================================

Contributions are welcome.  There are plenty of opportunities
for visible, important contributions to this module.  Here
is a partial list of the known problems and missing features:

a) Support for SecurityDescriptors for chmod/chgrp/chown so
these can be supported for Windows servers

b) Better pam/winbind integration

c) multi-user mounts - multiplexed sessionsetups over single vc
(ie tcp session) - prettying up needed

d) Kerberos/SPNEGO session setup support - (started)

e) NTLMv2 authentication and MD5-HMAC signing SMB PDUs - (mostly implemented)
	signing necessary for some Windows 2003 servers in domain 
	controller mode.

f) oplock support (ie safe CIFS distributed file caching) is not quite complete.
In addition Directory entry caching relies on a 1 second timer, rather than 
using FindNotify or equivalent.  - (started)

g) There may be a few additional changes that could be done to take advantage
of recent 2.5 kernel improvements in byte-range locking

h) quota support

i) support for the Linux 2.5 kernel new feature get_xattr and set_xattr
which will allow us to expose dos attributes as well as real
ACLs

j) finish off the mount helper, mount.cifs - (started)

k) finish writepages support (multi-page write behind for improved
performance) and syncpage

l) hook lower into the sockets api (as NFS/SunRPC does) to avoid the
extra copy in/out of the socket buffers in some cases.

m) finish support for IPv6

n) send oplock break response when sent (oplock currently disabled in
/proc/fs/cifs)

o) remove calls to set end of file by name when we already have file open
(use the existing handle since some servers only support that and it
reduces the oplock breaks coming from windows).  Piggyback identical
file opens on top of each other by incrementing reference count rather
than resending (helps reduce server resource utilization and avoid
spurious oplock breaks).


KNOWN BUGS (updated May 16, 2003)
====================================
1) existing symbolic links (Windows reparse points) are recognized but
can not be created remotely. They are implemented for Samba and those that
support the CIFS Unix extensions but Samba has a bug currently handling
symlink text beginning with slash
2) delete of file with read-only attribute set will fail (may be ok)
3) mount helper syntax not quite matching man page
4) follow_link and readdir code does not follow dfs junctions
but recognizes them
5) create of new files to FAT partitions on Windows servers can
succeed but still return access denied (appears to be Windows 
not client problem).  NTFS partitions do not have this problem.

Misc testing to do
=================
1) check out max path names and max path name components against various server
types.

2) Run dbench

3) Finish high stress fsx testing on SMP clients

4) Additional performance testing and optimization
