Version 0.72
------------
Add resume key support to search (readdir) code to workaround
Windows bug.  Add /proc/fs/cifs/LookupCacheEnable which
allows disabling caching of attribute information for
lookups.

Version 0.71
------------
Add more oplock handling (distributed caching code).  Remove
dead code.  Remove excessive stack space utilization from
symlink routines.

Version 0.70
------------
Fix oops in get dfs referral (triggered when null path sent in to
mount).  Add support for overriding rsize at mount time.

Version 0.69
------------
Fix buffer overrun in readdir which caused intermittent kernel oopses.
Fix writepage code to release kmap on write data.  Allow "-ip=" new 
mount option to be passed in on parameter distinct from the first part
(server name portion of) the UNC name.  Allow override of the
tcp port of the target server via new mount option "-port="  

Version 0.68
------------
Fix search handle leak on rewind.  Fix setuid and gid so that they are 
reflected in the local inode immediately.  Cleanup of whitespace
to make 2.4 and 2.5 versions more consistent.


Version 0.67
------------
Fix signal sending so that captive thread (cifsd) exits on umount 
(which was causing the warning in kmem_cache_free of the request buffers
at rmmod time).  This had broken as a sideeffect of the recent global
kernel change to daemonize.  Fix memory leak in readdir code which
showed up in "ls -R" (and applications that did search rewinding).

Version 0.66
------------
Reconnect tids and fids after session reconnection (still do not
reconnect byte range locks though).  Fix problem caching
lookup information for directory inodes, improving performance,
especially in deep directory trees.  Fix various build warnings.

Version 0.65
------------
Finish fixes to commit write for caching/readahead consistency.  fsx 
now works to Samba servers.  Fix oops caused when readahead
was interrupted by a signal.

Version 0.64
------------
Fix data corruption (in partial page after truncate) that caused fsx to
fail to Windows servers.  Cleaned up some extraneous error logging in
common error paths.  Add generic sendfile support.

Version 0.63
------------
Fix memory leak in AllocMidQEntry.
Finish reconnection logic, so connection with server can be dropped
(or server rebooted) and the cifs client will reconnect.  

Version 0.62
------------
Fix temporary socket leak when bad userid or password specified 
(or other SMBSessSetup failure).  Increase maximum buffer size to slightly
over 16K to allow negotiation of up to Samba and Windows server default read 
sizes.  Add support for readpages

Version 0.61
------------
Fix oops when username not passed in on mount.  Extensive fixes and improvements
to error logging (strip redundant newlines, change debug macros to ensure newline
passed in and to be more consistent).  Fix writepage wrong file handle problem,
a readonly file handle could be incorrectly used to attempt to write out
file updates through the page cache to multiply open files.  This could cause
the iozone benchmark to fail on the fwrite test. Fix bug mounting two different
shares to the same Windows server when using different usernames
(doing this to Samba servers worked but Windows was rejecting it) - now it is
possible to use different userids when connecting to the same server from a
Linux client. Fix oops when treeDisconnect called during unmount on
previously freed socket.

Version 0.60
------------
Fix oops in readpages caused by not setting address space operations in inode in 
rare code path. 

Version 0.59
------------
Includes support for deleting of open files and renaming over existing files (per POSIX
requirement).  Add readlink support for Windows junction points (directory symlinks).

Version 0.58
------------
Changed read and write to go through pagecache. Added additional address space operations.
Memory mapped operations now working.

Version 0.57
------------
Added writepage code for additional memory mapping support.  Fixed leak in xids causing
the simultaneous operations counter (/proc/fs/cifs/SimultaneousOps) to increase on 
every stat call.  Additional formatting cleanup. 

Version 0.56
------------
Fix bigendian bug in order of time conversion. Merge 2.5 to 2.4 version.  Formatting cleanup.   

Version 0.55
------------
Fixes from Zwane Mwaikambo for adding missing return code checking in a few places.
Also included a modified version of his fix to protect global list manipulation of
the smb session and tree connection and mid related global variables.

Version 0.54
------------
Fix problem with captive thread hanging around at unmount time.  Adjust to 2.5.42-pre
changes to superblock layout.   Remove wasteful allocation of smb buffers (now the send 
buffer is reused for responses).  Add more oplock handling. Additional minor cleanup.

Version 0.53
------------
More stylistic updates to better match kernel style.  Add additional statistics
for filesystem which can be viewed via /proc/fs/cifs.  Add more pieces of NTLMv2
and CIFS Packet Signing enablement.

Version 0.52
------------
Replace call to sleep_on with safer wait_on_event.
Make stylistic changes to better match kernel style recommendations.
Remove most typedef usage (except for the PDUs themselves).

Version 0.51
------------
Update mount so the -unc mount option is no longer required (the ip address can be specified
in a UNC style device name.   Implementation of readpage/writepage started.

Version 0.50
------------
Fix intermittent problem with incorrect smb header checking on badly 
fragmented tcp responses

Version 0.49
------------
Fixes to setting of allocation size and file size.

Version 0.48
------------
Various 2.5.38 fixes.  Now works on 2.5.38

Version 0.44
------------
Various big endian fixes for servers with Unix extensions such as Samba

Version 0.43
------------
Various FindNext fixes for incorrect filenames on large directory searches on big endian
clients.  basic posix file i/o tests now work on big endian machines, not just le

Version 0.42
------------
SessionSetup and NegotiateProtocol now work from Big Endian machines.
Various Big Endian fixes found during testing on the Linux on 390.  Various fixes for compatibility with older
versions of 2.4 kernel (now builds and works again on kernels at least as early as 2.4.7).

Version 0.41
------------
Various minor fixes for Connectathon Posix "basic" file i/o test suite.  Directory caching fixed so hardlinked
files now return the correct rumber of links on fstat as they are repeatedly linked and unlinked.

Version 0.40
------------
Implemented "Raw" (i.e. not encapsulated in SPNEGO) NTLMSSP (i.e. the Security Provider Interface used to negotiate
session advanced session authentication).  Raw NTLMSSP is preferred by Windows 2000 Professional and Windows XP.
Began implementing support for SPNEGO encapsulation of NTLMSSP based session authentication blobs
(which is the mechanism preferred by Windows 2000 server in the absence of Kerberos).

Version 0.38
------------
Introduced optional mount helper utility mount.cifs and made coreq changes to cifs vfs to enable
it. Fixed a few bugs in the DFS code (e.g. bcc two bytes too short and incorrect uid in PDU).

Version 0.37
------------
Rewrote much of connection and mount/unmount logic to handle bugs with
multiple uses to same share, multiple users to same server etc.

Version 0.36
------------
Fixed major problem with dentry corruption (missing call to dput)

Version 0.35
------------
Rewrite of readdir code to fix bug. Various fixes for bigendian machines.

although corresponding function not fully implemented in the vfs yet

Version 0.34
------------
Fixed dentry caching bug, misc. cleanup 

Version 0.33
------------
Fixed 2.5 support to handle build and configure changes as well as misc. 2.5 changes.  Now can build
on current 2.5 beta version (2.5.24) of the Linux kernel as well as on 2.4 Linux kernels.
Support for STATUS codes (newer 32 bit NT error codes) added.  DFS support begun to be added.

Version 0.32
------------
Unix extensions (symlink, readlink, hardlink, chmod and some chgrp and chown) implemented
and tested against Samba 2.2.5


Version 0.31
------------
1) Fixed lockrange to be correct (it was one byte too short)

2) Fixed GETLK (i.e. the fcntl call to test a range of bytes in a file to see if locked) to correctly 
show range as locked when there is a conflict with an existing lock.

3) default file perms are now 2767 (indicating support for mandatory locks) instead of 777 for directories
in most cases.  Eventually will offer optional ability to query server for the correct perms.

3) Fixed eventual trap when mounting twice to different shares on the same server when the first succeeded 
but the second one was invalid and failed (the second one was incorrectly disconnecting the tcp and smb
session) 

4) Fixed error logging of valid mount options

5) Removed logging of password field.

6) Moved negotiate, treeDisconnect and uloggoffX (only tConx and SessSetup remain in connect.c) to cifssmb.c
and cleaned them up and made them more consistent with other cifs functions. 

7) Server support for Unix extensions is now fully detected and FindFirst is implemented both ways 
(with or without Unix exentions) but FindNext and QueryPathInfo with the Unix extensions are not completed,
nor is the symlink support using the Unix extensions

8) Started adding the readlink and follow_link code 

Version 0.3 
-----------
Initial drop
