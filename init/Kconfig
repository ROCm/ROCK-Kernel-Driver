config EXPERIMENTAL
	bool "Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers"
	---help---
	  Some of the various things that Linux supports (such as network
	  drivers, file systems, network protocols, etc.) can be in a state
	  of development where the functionality, stability, or the level of
	  testing is not yet high enough for general use. This is usually
	  known as the "alpha-test" phase among developers. If a feature is
	  currently in alpha-test, then the developers usually discourage
	  uninformed widespread use of this feature by the general public to
	  avoid "Why doesn't this work?" type mail messages. However, active
	  testing and use of these systems is welcomed. Just be aware that it
	  may not meet the normal level of reliability or it may fail to work
	  in some special cases. Detailed bug reports from people familiar
	  with the kernel internals are usually welcomed by the developers
	  (before submitting bug reports, please read the documents
	  <file:README>, <file:MAINTAINERS>, <file:REPORTING-BUGS>,
	  <file:Documentation/BUG-HUNTING>, and
	  <file:Documentation/oops-tracing.txt> in the kernel source).

	  This option will also make obsoleted drivers available. These are
	  drivers that have been replaced by something else, and/or are
	  scheduled to be removed in a future kernel release.

	  Unless you intend to help test and develop a feature or driver that
	  falls into this category, or you have a situation that requires
	  using these features, you should probably say N here, which will
	  cause the configurator to present you with fewer choices. If
	  you say Y here, you will be offered the choice of using features or
	  drivers that are currently considered to be in the alpha-test phase.

menu "General setup"

config SWAP
	bool "Support for paging of anonymous memory"
	depends on MMU
	default y
	help
	  This option allows you to choose whether you want to have support
	  for socalled swap devices or swap files in your kernel that are
	  used to provide more virtual memory than the actual RAM present
	  in your computer.  If unsure say Y.

config SYSVIPC
	bool "System V IPC"
	---help---
	  Inter Process Communication is a suite of library functions and
	  system calls which let processes (running programs) synchronize and
	  exchange information. It is generally considered to be a good thing,
	  and some programs won't run unless you say Y here. In particular, if
	  you want to run the DOS emulator dosemu under Linux (read the
	  DOSEMU-HOWTO, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>), you'll need to say Y
	  here.

	  You can find documentation about IPC with "info ipc" and also in
	  section 6.4 of the Linux Programmer's Guide, available from
	  <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#guide>.

config BSD_PROCESS_ACCT
	bool "BSD Process Accounting"
	help
	  If you say Y here, a user level program will be able to instruct the
	  kernel (via a special system call) to write process accounting
	  information to a file: whenever a process exits, information about
	  that process will be appended to the file by the kernel.  The
	  information includes things such as creation time, owning user,
	  command name, memory usage, controlling terminal etc. (the complete
	  list is in the struct acct in <file:include/linux/acct.h>).  It is
	  up to the user level program to do useful things with this
	  information.  This is generally a good idea, so say Y.

config SYSCTL
	bool "Sysctl support"
	---help---
	  The sysctl interface provides a means of dynamically changing
	  certain kernel parameters and variables on the fly without requiring
	  a recompile of the kernel or reboot of the system.  The primary
	  interface consists of a system call, but if you say Y to "/proc
	  file system support", a tree of modifiable sysctl entries will be
	  generated beneath the /proc/sys directory. They are explained in the
	  files in <file:Documentation/sysctl/>.  Note that enabling this
	  option will enlarge the kernel by at least 8 KB.

	  As it is generally a good thing, you should say Y here unless
	  building a kernel for install/rescue disks or your system is very
	  limited in memory.

config LOG_BUF_SHIFT
	int "Kernel log buffer size" if DEBUG_KERNEL
	default 17 if ARCH_S390
	default 16 if X86_NUMAQ || IA64
	default 15 if SMP
	default 14
	help
	  Select kernel log buffer size as a power of 2.
	  Defaults and Examples:
	  	     17 => 128 KB for S/390
		     16 => 64 KB for x86 NUMAQ or IA-64
	             15 => 32 KB for SMP
	             14 => 16 KB for uniprocessor
		     13 =>  8 KB
		     12 =>  4 KB

menu "Loadable module support"

config MODULES
	bool "Enable loadable module support"
	help
	  Kernel modules are small pieces of compiled code which can be
	  inserted in or removed from the running kernel, using the programs
	  insmod and rmmod. This is described in the file
	  <file:Documentation/modules.txt>, including the fact that you have
	  to say "make modules" in order to compile the modules that you chose
	  during kernel configuration.  Modules can be device drivers, file
	  systems, binary executable formats, and so on. If you think that you
	  may want to make use of modules with this kernel in the future, then
	  say Y here.  If unsure, say Y.

config MODULE_UNLOAD
	bool "Module unloading"
	depends on MODULES
	help
	  Without this option you will not be able to unload any
	  modules (note that some modules may not be unloadable
	  anyway), which makes your kernel slightly smaller and
	  simpler.  If unsure, say Y.

config MODULE_FORCE_UNLOAD
	bool "Forced module unloading"
	depends on MODULE_UNLOAD && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  This option allows you to force a module to unload, even if the
	  kernel believes it is unsafe: the kernel will remove the module
	  without waiting for anyone to stop using it (using the -f option to
	  rmmod).  This is mainly for kernel developers and desperate users.
	  If unsure, say N.

config OBSOLETE_MODPARM
	bool
	default y
	depends on MODULES
	help
	  You need this option to use module parameters on modules which
	  have not been converted to the new module parameter system yet.
	  If unsure, say Y.

config MODVERSIONS
	bool "Module versioning support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on MODULES && EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Usually, you have to use modules compiled with your kernel.
	  Saying Y here makes it sometimes possible to use modules
	  compiled for different kernels, by adding enough information
	  to the modules to (hopefully) spot any changes which would
	  make them incompatible with the kernel you are running.  If
	  you say Y here, you will need a copy of genksyms.  If
	  unsure, say N.

config KMOD
	bool "Kernel module loader"
	depends on MODULES
	help
	  Normally when you have selected some drivers and/or file systems to
	  be created as loadable modules, you also have the responsibility to
	  load the corresponding modules (using the programs insmod or
	  modprobe) before you can use them. If you say Y here however, the
	  kernel will be able to load modules for itself: when a part of the
	  kernel needs a module, it runs modprobe with the appropriate
	  arguments, thereby loading the module if it is available. (This is a
	  replacement for kerneld.) Say Y here and read about configuring it
	  in <file:Documentation/kmod.txt>.
