	  This feature enables the handling of the "supported" module flag.
	  This flag can be used to report unsupported module loads or even
	  refuse them entirely. It is useful when ensuring that the kernel
	  remains in a state that SUSE, or its technical partners, is
	  prepared to support.

	  Modules in the list of supported modules will be marked supported
	  on build. The default enforcement mode is to report, but not
	  deny, loading of unsupported modules.

	  If you aren't building a kernel for an enterprise distribution,
	  say n.

config SUSE_KERNEL_RELEASE
